They count as warlock cantrips for you, but they don’t count against your number of cantrips known.<br><br><h4>Healing Light</h4>At 1st level, you gain the ability to channel celestial energy to heal wounds. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this healing. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level.<br><br>  As a bonus action, you can heal one creature you can see within 60 feet of you, spending dice from the pool.

Roll the dice you spend, add them together, and restore a number of hit points equal to the total.<br><br>  Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h4>Radiant Soul</h4>Starting at 6th level, your link to the Celestial allows you to serve as a conduit for radiant energy. You have resistance to radiant damage, and when you cast a spell that deals radiant or fire damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to one radiant or fire damage roll of that spell against one of its targets.<br><br><h4>Celestial Resilience</h4>Starting at 10th level, you gain temporary hit points whenever you finish a short or long rest.

When you have to make a death saving throw at the start of your turn, you can instead spring back to your feet with a burst of radiant energy. You regain hit points equal to half your hit point maximum, and then you stand up if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is within 30 feet of you takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your Charisma modifier, and it is blinded until the end of the current turn.<br><br>  Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","img":""}

Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood⁠ in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.<br><br><h2>Of Two Worlds</h2>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they’re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.<br><br><h2>Diplomats or Wanderers</h2>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.<br><br>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers, foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55226558/Toe_FEIkv24n6QNmWysCvA/med.png?1527976352\"></div><br><h2>Half-Elf Names</h2>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.<br><br><h2>Half-Elf Traits</h2>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common⁠ with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.<br><br><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood⁠ around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.<br><br><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em> </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkn⁠ess as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness⁠, only shades of gray.<br><br><strong><em>Fey Ancestry. </em></strong>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.<br><br><strong><em>Skill Versatility.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your choice.<br><br><strong>Excellent Ambassadors</strong><br>Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common⁠ ground. As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).","img":""}

That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.\n\t<br><br>The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.\n\t<br><br>As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character’s angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character’s guide.<br><br>\n\n\n<h5>Angelic Guide</h5><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d6</strong></td><td><strong>Name</strong></td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td><td>\nTadriel\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td><td>\nMyllandra\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td><td>\nSeraphina\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td><td>\nGalladia\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td><td>\nMykiel\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td><td>\nValandras&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table><table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>d6 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></td><td><strong>Nature</strong></td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n1\n</td><td>\nBookish and lecturing\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n2\n</td><td>\nCompassionate and hopeful\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n3\n</td><td>\nPractical and lighthearted\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n4\n</td><td>\nFierce and vengeful\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n5\n</td><td>\nStern and judgmental\n</td></tr><tr>\n<td>\n6\n</td><td>\nKind and parental&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<h4>Note to the DM: Playing an Angelic Guide</h4>\nAs DM, you take on the role of an aasimar’s angelic guide and decide what kind of advice or omens to send in dreams.\n\t<br><br>The deva, or other celestial being, is your chance to add special roleplaying opportunities to the game. Remember, a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Conflicted Souls</h2>\nDespite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.\n\t<br><br>Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them.\n\t<br><br>Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar’s guide is wise but not infallible.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Aasimar Names</h2>\nMost aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Aasimar Traits</h2>\nYour aasimar character has the following racial traits.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Aasimar mature at the same rate as humans, but they can live up to 160 years.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Imbued with celestial power, most aasimar are good. Outcast aasimar are most often neutral or even evil.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Aasimar have the same range of height and weight as humans.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Blessed with a radiant soul, your vision can easily cut through darkness. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Celestial Resistance.</em></strong> You have resistance to necrotic damage and radiant damage.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Healing Hands.</em></strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and cause it to regain a number of hit points equal to your level. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Light Bearer.</em></strong> You know the light cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Celestial.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Three subraces of aasimar exist: protector aasimar, scourge aasimar, and fallen aasimar. Choose one of them for your character.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>4'8\"</td><td>110 lb.</td><td>+2d10</td><td>× (2d4) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n\n<div><h3>Protector Aasimar</h3>\nProtector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Radiant Soul. </em></strong>\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to glimmer and two luminous, incorporeal wings to sprout from your back.\n\t<br><br>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you have a flying speed of 30 feet, and once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level.\n\t<br><br>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Scourge Aasimar</h3>\nScourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil—a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> \nYour Constitution score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Radiant Consumption.</em></strong> \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing a searing light to radiate from you, pour out of your eyes and mouth, and threaten to char you.\n\t<br><br>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet, and at the end of each of your turns, you and each creature within 10 feet of you take radiant damage equal to half your level (rounded up). In addition, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra radiant damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra radiant damage equals your level.\n\t<br><br>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><br>\n\n\n<h3>Fallen Aasimar</h3>\nAn aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen—a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> \nYour Strength score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Necrotic Shroud.</em></strong> \nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the divine energy within yourself, causing your eyes to turn into pools of darkness and two skeletal, ghostly, flightless wings to sprout from your back. The instant you transform, other creatures within 10 feet of you that can see you must each succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\n\t<br><br>Your transformation lasts for 1 minute or until you end it as a bonus action. During it, once on each of your turns, you can deal extra necrotic damage to one target when you deal damage to it with an attack or a spell. The extra necrotic damage equals your level.\n\t<br><br>Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><br>\n</div>\n\n\n<h3>Falling from Grace or Rising to It</h3>\nWith your DM’s consent, you can change your character’s subrace to fallen aasimar if your protector/scourge aasimar turns to evil. To do so, replace your subrace benefits, including the ability score increase, with those of a fallen aasimar.\n\t<br><br>Similarly, if your fallen aasimar turns to good, your DM might allow you to become a protector or scourge aasimar.<br>","img":""}

Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.</span><br></p><p>Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.</p><p>The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Names</span></h3><p>Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Traits</span></h3><p>A genasi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b>&nbsp;Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b>&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Languages.&nbsp;</i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.</p><p><b><i>Subraces.</i></b>&nbsp;There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4>Earth Genasi</h4><p>As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.</p><p>Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Strength score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Earth Walk.</i></b>&nbsp;You can move across difficult terrain made of earth and stone without expending extra movement.</p><p><b><i>Pass without Trace.</i></b>&nbsp;You can cast the&nbsp;<i>pass without trace</i>&nbsp;spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or the Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause. However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.<br><br><h4>Wild Magic Surge</h4>Starting when you choose this origin⁠ at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.<br><br><h4>Tides of Chaos</h4>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.<br><br>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher.

When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.<br><br><h4>Controlled Chaos</h4>At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use either number.<br><br><h4>Spell Bombardment</h4>Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage.

Corellon did not respond, for it is said that their divine ears still rang with pain after their duel to the death with Gruumsh, the Ruiner. Desperate and panicked, the greatest mages of the elves performed a ritual powerful enough to encase their entire civilization in ice, in hopes of protecting it from the wrath of the warring gods while the elves escaped into the Feywild.</p><p>It is said that the ashes of the Calamity still blew upon the breeze when, centuries later, the barriers of ice melted and the elves of Wildemount emerged from the Feywild once more. On their return to the world, they found that their ritual had not held fast. The Calamity had wiped almost all traces of elven civilization from Exandria. With only the ruined husks of their mighty cities still standing, the elves began to rebuild.</p><p>Even though the human-majority civilizations of the Dwendalian Empire and the Clovis Concord view elves as reclusive relics of the ancient past, most elves view themselves as newcomers to the world, for their return to Wildemount is only a generation or two removed from the present day. The notable exception are the dark elves of Xhorhas, who have lived in Eastern Wynandir since time immemorial. Still, it is only in the past few centuries that they have abandoned the labyrinthine caverns of the Underdark and emerged to live on the surface.</p><hr><h3><span>Elves in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Though the dark elves of Xhorhas are the subject of imperial propaganda and widespread prejudice, elves of other kinds living within the empire are generally treated as friends and allies. Imperial humans love to revere elves as ethereal, flawless beings, and to express shock when elves reveal the ways that they are all-to similar to humans. Elves who maintain their “exotic mystique” are most likely to become respected members of society, and many hold great social power within cities such as Zadash and Rexxentrum.</p><hr><h3><span>Elves on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Elves are commonplace in the Clovis Concord and among the pirates of the Revelry, and people living on this part of the continent most often laugh at tales of elven grace and beauty. “An elf bleeds just like everyone else” is a common saying on the Menagerie Coast, used to dismiss the fanciful sense of wonder common in the Empire—and the saying has evolved into a dismissal of all overwrought tales, even if the idiom doesn’t quite fit. Savvy buyers of curios and souvenirs might say, “Your wares bleed, just like everyone else’s” to a merchant who has exaggerated the quality of their goods.</p><p>Most elves on the Menagerie Coast are descended from travelers from the desert continent of Marquet, but this area is also home to two rare subraces of elf. The seas off the coast are inhabited by secluded civilizations of water-breathing sea elves, who trade with underwater enclaves of merfolk. All but the most idealistic or mercenary of these ocean dwellers see the petty squabbles of the “boat-riders” of the surface world as beneath their notice. At another geographic extreme, the moon-worshiping pallid elves of the Cyrios Mountains are new to the world, and are generally viewed with cordial curiosity by the denizens of the Concord’s cities.</p><hr><h3><span>Elves in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>The largest elf-majority civilization in Wildemount is the Kryn Dynasty of Xhorhas, which is made up primarily of dark elves. The drow of Xhorhas are respectful toward people of all races—including other elves—as they believe that their holy cycle of rebirth allows them to be reborn into non-drow bodies. The empathy to be gained by experiencing life in another body is crucial to their religion and their culture.</p><p>Elves who live outside the Luxon’s cycle of rebirth are viewed with pity, for they have not yet seen the true path. Elves who dwell within the Dwendalian Empire are a notable exception, their imperial allegiance earning them only the cold bite of a blade.</p><hr><h3><span>Elf Subraces</span></h3><p>At the DM’s discretion, players have access to the pallid elf and sea elf subraces described below, in addition to the elf subraces in the&nbsp;<i>Player’s Handbook</i>.</p><p><b><i>Height and Weight.&nbsp;</i></b>Here’s how to randomly determine the height and weight of a pallid elf or sea elf, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 6 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 90 + (1d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104304931/PyXmfbMSpFsUHgi2PwAkrg/original.png?1581353134\"><span><br></span></p><h4>Pallid Elf</h4><p>The pallid elves are a mystical and insightful people with skin as pale as the surface of Exandria’s largest moon.

{"_id":"MDMyNWZiMjNkMmJi","name":"Air Genasi","permission":{"default":2},"folder":null,"flags":{"R20Converter":{"handout-order":1,"handout-archived":false}},"sort":10000,"entryTime":0,"content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104306939/fe2nuLwPTJ8cigM75G08rQ/original.png?1581355034\"><br></p><p>Genasi are exceedingly rare on Exandria, as befits their unique origins. Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.</p><p>Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.</p><p>The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Names</span></h3><p>Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Traits</span></h3><p>A genasi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b>&nbsp;Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b>&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Languages.&nbsp;</i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.</p><p><b><i>Subraces.</i></b>&nbsp;There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4>Air Genasi</h4><p>As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.</p><p>Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;</i></b>Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Unending Breath.&nbsp;</i></b>You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.</p><p><b><i>Mingle with the Wind.</i></b>&nbsp;You can cast the levitate spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest.

They claim no mastery over nature. Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomita⁠ble will.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55139629/H_X7AOcoazo9rxXYPgA1dg/med.png?1527883739\"></div><br><h3>Power of Nature</h3>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.<br><br>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55139828/wgZXmrOPJsGSFnkIBj4Vzw/med.png?1527883908\"></div><br><h3>Preserve the Balance⁠</h3>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others.<br><br>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’ territory.<br><br>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.<br><br><h3>Creating a Druid</h3>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny.<br><br>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling, or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message⁠. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic.<br><br><h3>Spellcasting</h3>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See the general rules of spellcasting and the druid spell list.<br><br><h4>Cantrips</h4>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.<br><br><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells⁠</h4>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠.<br><br>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Ability</h4>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier</div><br><h4>Ritual Casting</h4>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.<br><br><strong>Sacred Plants and Wood</strong><br>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants⁠ as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.<br><br>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with stre⁠ngth. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.<br><br>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants⁠ to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants⁠.<br><br><h3>Wild Shape</h3>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.<br><br><strong>Beast Shapes</strong><br><div><table><thead><tr><td>Level⁠</td><td>Max. CR</td><td>Limitations</td><td>Example</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2nd</td><td>1/4</td><td>No flying or swimming speed</td><td>Wolf</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>1/2</td><td>No flying speed</td><td>Crocodile</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1</td><td>—</td><td>Giant eagle</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.<br><br>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:<br><br><ul><li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics⁠ of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li><li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li><li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <em>call lightning</em>, that you’ve already cast.</li><li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special⁠ senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li><li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment⁠ functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment⁠ doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment⁠ that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment⁠ that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li></ul><h3>Druid Circle</h3>At 2nd level, you choose to identify⁠ with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Timeless Body</h3>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.<br><br><h3>Beast Spells⁠</h3>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able to provide material components.<br><br><h3>Archdruid</h3>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.<br><br>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55140659/eU4H60ctT05WnoKafLn4Bg/med.png?1527884565\"></div><br><strong>Druids and the Gods</strong><br>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.<br><br>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.<br><br>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command⁠ these spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic⁠ is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228128/9uh2syXXafz6jmvqY5yDSw/med.png?1527977539\"></div><br><h2>Druid Circles</h2>Though their organization is invi⁠sible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters.

Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.<br><br>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.<br><br>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.<br><br>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells⁠ of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells⁠ change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55237960/VHq1gW0hhySD0IjVQKW8ug/med.png?1527982118\"></div><br><h3>Scholars of the Arcane</h3>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.<br><br>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells⁠ as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55238126/Y7m572a5a63wOV8Er1beqQ/med.png?1527982203\"></div><br><h3>The Lure of Knowledge</h3>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library⁠ or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.<br><br>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.<br><br><h3>Creating a Wizard</h3>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?<br><br>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard? Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the test in the face of danger.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage background. Third, choose the <em>mage hand</em>, <em>light</em>, and <em>ray of frost </em>cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook: <em>burning hands</em>, <em>charm person</em>, <em>feather fall</em>, <em>mage armor</em>, <em>magic missile</em>, and <em>sleep</em>.<br><br><strong>The

features.<br><br><h4>Hit Points</h4><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>1d6 per wizard level<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels: </strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st<br><br><h4>Proficiencies</h4><strong>Armor:</strong> None<br><strong>Weapons: </strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br><strong>Tools: </strong>None<br><br><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br><strong>Skills: </strong>Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion<br><br><h4>Equipment</h4>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:<br><br><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) a quarterstaff or (<em>b</em>) a dagger</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a component pouch or (<em>b</em>) an arcane focus</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a scholar’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li><li>A spellbook</li></ul><h3>Spellcasting</h3>As a student of arcane magic⁠, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See&nbsp;\"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and the wizard spell list under&nbsp; \"Wizard Spells by Level\".<br><br><h4>Cantrips</h4>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.<br><br><h4>Spellbook</h4>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook⁠ is the repository of the wizard spells⁠ you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.<br><br><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. <br><br>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells⁠ from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>magic missile</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠.<br><br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells⁠ requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells⁠ through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Intelligence modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus +<br>your Intelligence modifier</div><br><strong>Your Spellbook⁠</strong><br>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells⁠ during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library⁠.<br><br><strong><em>Copying a Spell into the Book⁠. </em></strong>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.<br><br>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook⁠ using your own notation.<br><br>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.<br><br><strong><em>Replacing the Book⁠. </em></strong>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook⁠. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook⁠, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.<br><br>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook⁠. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells⁠ to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.<br><br><strong><em>The Book’s Appearance. </em></strong>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library⁠, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook⁠ in a mishap.<br><br><h4>Ritual Casting</h4>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.<br><br><h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h4>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook”).<br><br><h3>Arcane Recovery</h3>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.<br><br>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.<br><br><h3>Arcane Tradition</h3>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.<br><br>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Spell Mastery</h3>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells⁠ at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.<br><br>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells⁠ of the same levels.<br><br><h3>Signature Spells⁠</h3>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells⁠ in your spellbook⁠ as your signature spells⁠. You always have these spells⁠ prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells⁠ you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55238363/88taSxBwsdUJq0oOCs0otg/med.png?1527982394\"><br><br><h2>Arcane Traditions</h2>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.<br><br>  The most common⁠ arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells⁠ of each school require mastery of different techniques.<p></p><ul><li>@Item[School of Abjuration]</li><li>@Item[School of Conjuration]</li><li>@Item[School of Divination]</li><li>@Item[School of Enchantment]</li><li>@Item[School of Evocation]</li><li>@Item[School of Illusion]</li><li>@Item[School of Necromancy]</li><li>@Item[School of Transmutation]</li></ul><p>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p><ul><li>@Item[War Magic]</li></ul>","img":""}

Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against ⁠darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55229111/1XFvK-pwzNMvBntWFFciOg/med.png?1527978113\"></div><br><h4>Tenets of the Ancients</h4>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.<br><br><strong><em>Kindle the Light⁠. </em></strong>Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.<br><br><strong><em>Shelter the Light⁠.</em></strong> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.<br><br><strong><em>Preserve Your Own Light⁠.</em></strong> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can’t preserve it in the world.<br><br><strong><em>Be the Light⁠. </em></strong>Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.<br><br><h4>Oath Spells</h4>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.<br><br><strong>Oath of the Ancients Spells</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>ensnaring strike, speak with animals</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>misty step, moonbeam</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>plant growth, protection from energy</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>ice storm, stoneskin</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>commune with nature, tree stride</em></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>Channel Divinity</h4>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.<br><br><strong><em>Nature’s Wrath. </em></strong>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.<br><br><strong><em>Turn the Faithless. </em></strong>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.<br><br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br><br>If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.<br><br><h4>Aura of Warding</h4>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to damage from spells.<br><br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.<br><br><h4>Undying Sentinel</h4>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br><br>Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can’t be aged magically.<br><br><h4>Elder Champion</h4>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.<br><br>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:<br><br><ul><li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li><li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li><li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li></ul><br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.<br>","img":""}

Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of their special⁠ attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228316/tP_Ne2reUHwx1nedzn7rPA/med.png?1527977694\"></div><br><h3>Training and Asceticism</h3>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.<br><br>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command⁠ of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.<br><br>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile⁠ warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.<br><br>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228461/4_9GlkSJ60E2d6eROenIlA/med.png?1527977807\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Monk</h3>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?<br><br>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?<br><br>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the hermit background.<br><br><strong>The Monk</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency<br>Bonus</td><td>Martial<br>Arts</td><td>Ki<br>Points</td><td>Unarmored<br>Movement</td><td>Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>Unarmored Defense, Martial Arts</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>2</td><td>+10 ft.</td><td>Ki, Unarmored Movement</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>3</td><td>+10 ft.</td><td>Monastic Tradition, Deflect Missiles</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>1d4</td><td>4</td><td>+10 ft.</td><td>Ability Score Improvement.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li><li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li></ul><br>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.<br><br><h3>Ki</h3>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.<br><br>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.<br><br>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.<br><br>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:<br><br><div><strong>Ki save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier</div><br><h4>Flurry of Blows</h4>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.<br><br><h4>Patient Defense</h4>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br><h4>Step of the Wind</h4>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.<br><br><h3>Unarmored Movement⁠</h3>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.<br><br>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.<br><br><h3>Monastic Tradition</h3>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.<br><br><h3>Deflect Missiles</h3>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the att⁠ack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged att⁠ack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this atta⁠ck with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the att⁠ack.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Slow Fall</h3>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.<br><br><h3>Extra Attack</h3>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br><br><h3>Stunning Strike</h3>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.<br><br><h3>Ki-Empowered Strikes</h3>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<br><br><h3>Evasion</h3>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <em>fireball</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.<br><br><h3>Stillness of Mind</h3>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.<br><br><h3>Purity of Body</h3>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.<br><br><h3>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h3>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.<br><br><h3>Diamond Soul</h3>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.<br><br>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.<br><br><h3>Timeless Body</h3>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.<br><br><h3>Empty Body</h3>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage.<br><br>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the <em>astral projection</em> spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.<br><br><h3>Perfect Self</h3>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.<br><br><strong>Monastic Orders</strong><br>The worlds of D&amp;D contain a multitude of monasteries and monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the western lands of Faerûn, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.<br><br>Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar (goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of endurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names of great heroes of the faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host. In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery. <br><br>The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles of their nation and their race—the belief that the Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228409/UW8eeI6S4aJ2-DP2sIXxYA/med.png?1527977772\"></div><br><h2>Monastic Traditions</h2>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common⁠ in the monasteries scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.<br><br><h2>Subclasses</h2><ul><li>@Item[Way of the Open Hand]</li><li>@Item[Way of Shadow]</li><li>@Item[Way of the Four Elements]</li></ul><p>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p><ul><li>@Item[Way of the Drunken Master]</li><li>@Item[Way of the Kensei]</li><li>@Item[Way of the Sun Soul]</li></ul>\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus—overlord of the Nine Hells—into their bloodline. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.<br><br><h3>Infernal⁠ Bloodline</h3>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal⁠ heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.<br><br><h3>Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.<br><br>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55131939/iIXmRfE3kmlzZFi-EfUIGA/med.png?1527876796\"></div><br><strong>Mutual Mistrust</strong><br>People tend to be suspicious of tieflings, assuming that their infernal⁠ heritage has left its mark on their personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a close eye on their goods when tieflings enter their stores, the town watch might follow a tiefling around for a while, and demagogues blame tieflings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a tiefling’s bloodline doesn’t affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.<br><br><h3>Tiefling Names</h3>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim destiny.<br><br><strong>Male Infernal Names:</strong> Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai<br><br><strong>Female Infernal Names:</strong> Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta<br><br><strong>“Virtue” Names:</strong> Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary<br><br><h2>Tiefling Traits</h2>Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal⁠ descent.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2.<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up there.

Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.</p><p>Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.</p><p>The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Names</span></h3><p>Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Traits</span></h3><p>A genasi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b>&nbsp;Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b>&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Languages.&nbsp;</i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.</p><p><b><i>Subraces.</i></b>&nbsp;There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4>Fire Genasi</h4><p>As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.</p><p>Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens spot actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b>&nbsp;You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is a shade of red.</p><p><b><i>Fire Resistance.&nbsp;</i></b>You have resistance to fire damage.</p><p><b><i>Reach to the Blaze.</i></b>&nbsp;You know the&nbsp;<i>produce flame</i>&nbsp;cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast&nbsp;<i>burning hands</i>&nbsp;as a 1st-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

This special attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 30 feet. You are proficient with it, and you add your Dexterity modifier to its attack and damage rolls.

Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.<br>  <br>While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.<br><br><h4>Tenets of Redemption</h4>The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.<br><br>  <em><strong>Peace.</strong></em> Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.<br><br>  <em><strong>Innocence.</strong></em> All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, you can set anyone on a righteous path.<br><br><em><strong>Patience.</strong></em> Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once you have planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, you must work day after day to allow that seed to survive and flourish.<br><br>  <em><strong>Wisdom.</strong></em> Your heart and mind must stay clear, for eventually you will be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that you have no choice but to end their lives for the greater good.

Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55226744/7XeO8EloimElZBF_zZUZbg/med.png?1527976499\"></div><br><h2>The Mark of Gruumsh</h2>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can’t fully escape his influence. The same is true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs⁠ hear the whispers of Gruumsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh’s exultation when they join in melee combat—and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs⁠ are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.<br><br>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures—feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing—fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs⁠ are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilized land.<br><br><h2>Tribes and Slums</h2>Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are most likely to accept half-orcs⁠, and half-orcs⁠ almost always live in human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves among rough barbarian⁠ tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of larger cities, half-orcs⁠ get by on their physical might, their endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human ancestry.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55226769/9nZYZvt7fIQIv3KQhDlUaQ/med.png?1527976521\"></div><br><h2>Half-Orc Names</h2>Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc⁠ who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs⁠ with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.<br><br><strong>Male Orc Names: </strong>Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk<br><br><strong>Female Orc Names: </strong>Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak, Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda<br><br><h2>Half-Orc Traits</h2>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em> </strong>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood⁠ around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs⁠ raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.<br><br><em><strong>Size.</strong> </em>Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em> </strong>Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness⁠, only shades of gray.<br><br><strong><em>Menacing.</em></strong> You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.<br><br><strong><em>Relentless⁠ Endurance.</em></strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.<br><br><em><strong>Savage Attacks.</strong> </em>When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.<br><br><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc⁠ is a harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish script.<br><br><strong>Grudging Acceptance</strong><br>Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.","img":""}

When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin’s current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.<br><br><h3>Changeable Nature</h3>Whenever one of the eladrin⁠ presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't incapacitated⁠.

When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Humble Guardians</h2>\nFirbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and monuments to the durability of life.<br><br>In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime.<br><br>In a firbolg’s eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short?\n\n<br><br>\n\n<h2>Natural Druids</h2>\nFirbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic.\n<br><br>Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group’s needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land during a famine.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<h2>Hidden Shepherds</h2>\nAs caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don’t try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own laws.\n\n<br><br>Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest.\n\n<br><br>Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs’ presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.\n\t\n<br><br>If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.\n\n<br><br>\n<h2>Outcast Adventurers</h2>\nAs guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.\n\t\n<br><br>Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home.\n\t\n<br><br>Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or homelands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.\n\t\n<br><br>A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.\n\t\n<br><br>The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration for determining why a firbolg character leaves home.<br><br>\n\n\n<h5>Firbolg Adventurers</h5>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong></strong>d8</td><td><strong>Reason for Adventuring</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Outcast for murder<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Outcast for severely damaging home territory<br></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Clan slain by invading humanoids<br></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Clan slain by a dragon or demon<br></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Separated from the tribe and lost<br></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Homeland destroyed by natural disaster<br></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Personal quest ordained by omens<br></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Dispatched on a quest by tribe leaders</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n<br>\n<h2>Firbolg Names</h2>\nFirbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest’s children by their deeds, habits, and other actions.\n\t\n<br><br>By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it “home.”\n\t\n<br><br>Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.\n\n<br><br>\n\n<h2>Firbolg Traits</h2>\nYour firbolg character has the following racial traits.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Strength score increases by 1.\n\n<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> As humanoids related to the fey, firbolg have long lifespans. A firbolg reaches adulthood around 30, and the oldest of them can live for 500 years.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em> </strong>As people who follow the rhythm of nature and see themselves as its caretakers, firbolg are typically neutral good. Evil firbolg are rare and are usually the sworn enemies of the rest of their kind.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Firbolg are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 240 and 300 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Firbolg Magic.</em></strong> You can cast <em>detect magic</em> and <em>disguise self</em> with this trait, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for them. Once you cast either spell, you can’t cast it again with this trait until you finish a short or long rest. When you use this version of disguise self, you can seem up to 3 feet shorter than normal, allowing you to more easily blend in with humans and elves.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Hidden Step.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you can magically turn invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em></strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Speech of Beast and Leaf.</em> </strong>You have the ability to communicate in a limited manner with beasts and plants. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.\n\t\n<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and Giant.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>6'2\"</td><td>175 lb.<br></td><td>+2d12</td><td>× (2d6) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Firbolg Classes</h2><strong>\nMost firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters.</strong> Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs’ magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan’s lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.\n\t\n<br><br><strong>Firbolg rogues</strong> are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.\n\t\n<br><br><strong>Firbolg barbarians</strong> are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders.\n\t\n<br><br><strong>Firbolg clerics</strong> and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods and are seen as enforcers of that god’s will.\n\t\n<br><br><strong>Firbolg warlocks</strong> are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings.\n\t\n<br><br><strong>Firbolg monks</strong> are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan.","img":""}

The bard is a master of song, speech⁠, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and that echoes of these primordial⁠ Words of Creation⁠ still resound throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.<br><br>The greatest stre⁠ngth of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat⁠, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells⁠. They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.<br><br><h3>Learning from Experience</h3>True bards are not common⁠ in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories, and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other entertainer⁠. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.<br><br>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic, decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.<br><br><h3>Creating a Bard</h3>Bards thrive on stories, whether those stories are true or not. Your character’s background and motivations are not as important as the stories that he or she tells about them. Perhaps you had a secure and mundane childhood⁠. There’s no good story to be told about that, so you might paint yourself as an orphan raised by a hag in a dismal swamp. Or your childhood⁠ might be worthy of a story. Some bards acquire their magical music through extraordinary means, including the inspi⁠ration of fey or other supernatural creatures.<br><br>Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced bard until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied bardic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering bard who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a bard quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background. Third, choose the <em>dancing lights</em> and <em>vicious mockery</em> cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells: <em>charm person</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>healing word</em>, and <em>thunderwave</em>.<br><br><strong>The

instrument</li><li>Leather armor and a dagger</li></ul><br><h3>Spellcasting⁠</h3>You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the bard spell list.<br><br><h4>Cantrips</h4>You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.<br><br><h4>Spell Slots</h4>The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>cure wounds</em>⁠ using either slot.<br><br><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.<br><br>The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells⁠ of your choice.

Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier<br><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier</div><br><h4>Ritual Casting</h4>You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Focus</h4>You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip­ment”) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55227491/bfq2vNR-m46SoiJKRrayaQ/med.png?1527977056\"></div><br><h3>Bardic Insp⁠i⁠ration</h3>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Insp⁠ira⁠tion die, a d6.<br><br>Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Insp⁠iration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiratio⁠n die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspir⁠ation die at a time.<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><br>Your Bardic Inspira⁠tion die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.<br><br><h3>Jack of All Trades</h3>Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.<br><br><h3>Song of Rest</h3>Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.<br><br>The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.<br><br><h3>Bard College</h3>At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.<br><br><h3>Expertise</h3>At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.<br><br>At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Font of Inspir⁠ation</h3>Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspirati⁠on when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br><h3>Countercharm</h3>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).<br><br><h3>Magical Secrets</h3>By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.<br><br>The chosen spells count as bard spells⁠ for you and are included in the number in the Spells⁠ Known column of the Bard table.<br><br>You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again at 18th level.<br><br><h3>Superior Insp⁠iration</h3>At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspi⁠ration left, you regain one use.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55135959/r9yqeZ8b0I_vdpYITlmbdA/med.png?1527880748\"></div><br><h2>Bard Colleges</h2>The way of the bard is gregarious.

Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.<br><br>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.<br><br>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes.

Thus enamored, many join a ship’s crew and set out to explore the Lucidian Ocean with their new allies. The common people of the Menagerie Coast look upon the aarakocra’s bright wings with awe and dream about taking to the sky, but are often baffled by their seemingly nonsensical idioms and figures of speech.</p><hr><h3><span>Aarakocra in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Aarakocra are native to the mountains and jungles of western Wildemount, and have precious few settlements in the mountains surrounding Xhorhas. The average Kryn dark elf would react to the sight of an aarakocra with shock, for they have neither stories nor experience with such creatures.</p><hr><h3><span>Aarakocra Names</span></h3><p>As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other races, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.</p><p><b>Aarakocra Names: </b>Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed</p><hr><h3><span>Aarakocra Traits</span></h3><p>Being able to fly at high speed at 1st level is exceptionally effective in certain circumstances and exceedingly dangerous in others. Keep this in mind before allowing your players to choose this race.</p><p>An aarakocra character has the following traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Age. </i></b>Aarakocra reach maturity by age 3. They don’t usually live longer than 30 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Most aarakocra are good and rarely choose sides when it comes to law and chaos. Tribal leaders and warriors might be lawful, while explorers and adventurers might tend toward chaotic.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Aarakocra average 5 feet tall and have slender, lightweight bodies. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d8<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 3 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 70 + (1d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p><p><b><i>Flight. </i></b>You have a flying speed of 50 feet. To use this speed, you can’t be wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><p><b><i>Talons. </i></b>Your talons are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Aarakocra, Auran, and Common.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Regis was short, even by the standards of his diminutive race, with the fluff of his curly brown locks barely cresting the three-foot mark, but his belly was amply thickened by his love of a good meal, or several, as the opportunities presented themselves. The crooked stick that served as his fishing pole rose up above him, clenched between two of his toes, and hung out over the quiet lake, mirrored perfectly in the glassy surface of Maer Dualdon.</em><br></blockquote><div>—R.A. Salvatore, <em>The Crystal⁠ Shard</em><br></div><br>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings’ lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55082547/oookygQChQGXENjNHkZD1w/med.png?1527808235\"></div><br><h2>Small and Practical</h2>The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the sha⁠dow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.<br><br>Halflings’ skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.<br><br>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They’re concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.<br><br><h2>Kind and Curious</h2>Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.<br><br>Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.<br><br><h2>Blend into the Crowd</h2>Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth⁠ and their unassuming nature helps halflings⁠ to avoid unwanted attention.<br><br>Halflings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their friends, whether halfling or otherwise. They can display remarkable ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are threatened.<br><br><h2>Pastoral Pleasantries</h2>Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don’t recognize any sort of halfling nobility or royalty, instead looking to family elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite the rise and fall of empires.<br><br>Many halflings live among other races, where the halflings’ hard work and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts. Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55226368/8oyQv7CSyIsKlzfuzpn3RA/med.png?1527976171\"></div><br><h2>Exploring Opportunities</h2>Halflings usually set out on the adventurer’s path to defend their communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-filled world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or sometimes a necessity.<br><br><h2>Halfling Names</h2>A halfling has a given name, a family name, and possibly a nickname. Family names are often nicknames that stuck so tenaciously they have been passed down through the generations.<br><br><strong>Male Names:</strong> Alton, Ander, Cade, Corrin, Eldon, Errich, Finnan, Garret, Lindal, Lyle, Merric, Milo, Osborn, Perrin, Reed, Roscoe, Wellby<br><br><strong>Female Names:</strong> Andry, Bree, Callie, Cora, Euphemia, Jillian, Kithri, Lavinia, Lidda, Merla, Nedda, Paela, Portia, Seraphina, Shaena, Trym, Vani, Verna<br><br><strong>Family Names:</strong> Brushgather, Goodbarrel, Greenbottle, High-hill, Hilltopple, Leagallow, Tealeaf, Thorngage, Tosscobble, Underbough<br><br><strong>Affable and Positive</strong><br>Halflings try to get along with everyone else and are loath to make sweeping generalizations—especially negative ones.<br><br><strong><em>Dwarves. </em></strong>“Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?”<br><br><strong><em>Elves. </em></strong>“They’re so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their grace and all. It’s like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. But there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling faces—surely more than they ever let on.”<br><br><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> “Humans are a lot like us, really. At least some of them are. Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders and you’ll find good, solid folk. Not that there’s anything wrong with the barons and soldiers—you have to admire their conviction.

Your size is Small.<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br><br><strong><em>Lucky⁠. </em></strong>When you roll a 1 on the d20⁠ for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.<br><br><strong><em>Brave.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.<br><br><strong><em>Halfling Nimbleness.</em></strong> You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings⁠ are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings⁠ speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.<br><br><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like closely related families than true subraces.

Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes⁠ take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation⁠, and play.<br><br><h2>Vibrant Expression</h2>A gnome’s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome’s insatiable interest in everything around.<br><br>A gnome’s personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome’s beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome’s clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.<br><br><h3>Delighted Dedication</h3>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes⁠ seem to worry that even with all that time, they can’t get in enough of the things they want to do and see.<br><br>Gnomes speak as if they can’t get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.<br><br>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they’re just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes⁠ are skilled⁠ engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors. They’re willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.<br><br><h3>Bright Burrows</h3>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.<br><br>Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55085316/uoW3h_6QXcnr5JO65_WXbQ/original.png?1527809938\"></div><br><h2>Gnome Names</h2>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the most fun to say.<br><br><strong>Male Names: </strong>Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble, Eldon, Erky, Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen, Namfoodle, Orryn, Roondar, Seebo, Sindri, Warryn, Wrenn, Zook<br><br><strong>Female Names: </strong>Bimpnottin, Breena, Caramip, Carlin, Donella, Duvamil, Ella, Ellyjobell, Ellywick, Lilli, Loopmottin, Lorilla, Mardnab, Nissa, Nyx, Oda, Orla, Roywyn, Shamil, Tana, Waywocket, Zanna<br><br><strong>Clan Names: </strong>Beren, Daergel, Folkor, Garrick, Nackle, Murnig, Ningel, Raulnor, Scheppen, Timbers, Turen<br><br><strong>Nicknames:</strong> Aleslosh, Ashhearth, Badger, Cloak, Doublelock, Filchbatter, Fnipper, Ku, Nim, Oneshoe, Pock, Sparklegem, Stumbleduck<br><br><h2>Seeing the World</h2>Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes⁠ take to adventuring⁠ as a quick, if dangerous, path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes⁠ who adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of their adventuring⁠ companions.<br><br><strong>Always Appreciative</strong><br>It’s rare for a gnome to be hostile or malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know that most races don’t share their sense of humor, but they enjoy anyone’s company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to do.<br><br><h2>Gnome Traits</h2>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common⁠ with all other gnomes.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Intelligence score increases by 2.<br><br><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment. </em></strong>Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes⁠ are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 25 feet.<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness⁠, only shades of gray.<br><br><strong><em>Gnome Cunning. </em></strong>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world.<br><br><strong><em>Subrace. </em></strong>Two subraces of gnomes are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: forest gnomes and rock gnomes.

These glistening arches were the city’s only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost. The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness.</em><br></blockquote><div>—Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman, <em>Dragons of Autumn Twilight <br></em><br></div><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55056032/OLLS2BfyxT1TlSC48xVWZw/med.png?1527779497\"></div><div><em>Drizzt Do'Urden</em></div><br>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.<br><br><h2>Slender and Graceful</h2>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.<br><br>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.<br><br><h2>A Timeless Perspective</h2>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless⁠. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.<br><br>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.<br><br><h2>Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art object⁠s. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).<br><br>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55220914/tcilpRSuJPwV0sciM076Lg/med.png?1527971825\"></div><br><h2>Exploration and Adventure</h2>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elve⁠s also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and advent⁠uring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.<br><br><h2>Elf Names</h2>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.<br>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation⁠, though it might reflect the names of respected individuals or other family members. Little distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves traveling among humans translate their family names into Common, but others retain the Elvish version.<br><br><strong>Child Names:</strong> Ara, Bryn, Del, Eryn, Faen, Innil, Lael, Mella, Naill, Naeris, Phann, Rael, Rinn, Sai, Syllin, Thia, Vall<br><br><strong>Male Adult Names:</strong> Adran, Aelar, Aramil, Arannis, Aust, Beiro, Berrian, Carric, Enialis, Erdan, Erevan, Galinndan, Hadarai, Heian, Himo, Immeral, Ivellios, Laucian, Mindartis, Paelias, Peren, Quarion, Riardon, Rolen, Soveliss, Thamior, Tharivol, Theren, Varis<br><br><strong>Female Adult Names:</strong> Adrie, Althaea, Anastrianna, Andraste, Antinua, Bethrynna, Birel, Caelynn, Drusilia, Enna, Felosial, Ielenia, Jelenneth, Keyleth, Leshanna, Lia, Meriele, Mialee, Naivara, Quelenna, Quillathe, Sariel, Shanairra, Shava, Silaqui, Theirastra, Thia, Vadania, Valanthe, Xanaphia<br><br><strong>Family Names (Common Translations): </strong>Amakiir (Gemflower), Amastacia (Starflower), Galanodel (Moonwhisper), Holimion (Diamonddew), Ilphelkiir (Gemblossom), Liadon (Silverfrond), Meliamne (Oakenheel), Naïlo (Nightbreeze), Siannodel (Moonbrook), Xiloscient (Goldpetal)<br><br><strong> Haughty but Gracious</strong><br>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations—which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.<br><br><strong><em>Dwarves.</em></strong> “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”<br><br><strong><em>Halflings.</em></strong> “Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises.”<br><br><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away—human endeavors seem so futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”<br><br><h2>Elf Traits</h2>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2.<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood⁠ and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.<br><br><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions⁠. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkn⁠ess as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkne⁠ss⁠, only shades of gray.<br><br><strong><em>Keen Senses.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.<br><br><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.<br><br><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting⁠ in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish⁠ is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.<br><br><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.<p></p><h3>Subraces</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dark Elf (Drow)#h-Dark Elf (Drow)\">Dark Elf (Drow)</a></li><li>@Item[High Elf]</li><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wood Elf#h-Wood Elf\">Wood Elf</a></li></ul><p>Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Eladrin#h-Eladrin\">Eladrin</a></li><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Sea Elf#h-Sea Elf\">Sea Elf</a></li><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Shadar-kai#h-Shadar-kai\">Shadar-kai</a></li></ul><p><br></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55079443/uTI62g5ccPOTRTnhLwBuCw/original.png?1527805283\"></div><div><br></div>\n\t\t\t\t<p></p>","img":""}

To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Deities of the grave include Kelemvor, Wee Jas, the ancestral spirits of the Undying Court, Hades, Anubis, and Osiris. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying. Their magic also allows them to stave off death for a time, particularly for a person who still has some great work to accomplish in the world. This is a delay of death, not a denial of it, for death will eventually get its due.<br><br><strong>Grave Domain Features</strong><table>\n<thead><tr><th><br></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td><b>Cleric Level</b></td><td><b>Feature</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Domain Spells, Circle of Mortality, Eyes of the Grave</td></tr>\n <tr><td>2nd</td><td>Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave</td></tr>\n <tr><td>6th</td><td>Sentinel at Death's Door</td></tr>\n <tr><td>8th</td><td>Potent Spellcasting</td></tr>\n <tr><td>17th</td><td>Keeper of Souls</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><h4>Domain Spells</h4>You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Grave Domain Spells table.

The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins—called hell knights—as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.<br><br><h4>Tenets of Conquest</h4>A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.<br>  <br><em><strong>Douse the Flame of Hope.</strong></em> It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Your victory must be so overwhelming that your enemies’ will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.<br><br>  <em><strong>Rule with an Iron Fist.</strong></em> Once you have conquered, tolerate no dissent. Your word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.<br><br>  <em><strong>Strength Above All.</strong></em> You shall rule until a stronger one arises. Then you must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to your own ruin.<br><br><strong>Oath of Conquest Features</strong><table>\n<thead><tr><th><br></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td><b>Paladin Level</b></td><td><b>Feature</b></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Oath Spells, Channel Divinity</td></tr>\n <tr><td>7th</td><td>Aura of Conquest (10 ft.)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>15th</td><td>Scornful Rebuke</td></tr>\n <tr><td>18th</td><td>Aura of Conquest (30 ft.)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>20th</td><td>Invincible Conqueror</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><h4>Oath Spells</h4>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Conquest Spells table.

As an action, you force each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br><br>  <em><strong>Guided Strike.</strong></em> You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy. When you make an attack roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a +10 bonus to the roll. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.<br><br><h4>Aura of Conquest</h4>Starting at 7th level, you constantly emanate a menacing aura while you’re not incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.<br><br>  If a creature is frightened of you, its speed is reduced to 0 while in the aura, and that creature takes psychic damage equal to half your paladin level if it starts its turn there.<br>  <br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.<br><br><h4>Scornful Rebuke</h4>Starting at 15th level, those who dare to strike you are psychically punished for their audacity. Whenever a creature hits you with an attack, that creature takes psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) if you’re not incapacitated.<br><br><h4>Invincible Conqueror</h4>At 20th level, you gain the ability to harness extraordinary martial prowess. As an action, you can magically become an avatar of conquest, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:<br><ul><li>You have resistance to all damage.</li><li>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.</li><li>Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li></ul>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.","img":""}

Most often, sorcerers with this origi⁠n trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.<br><br><h4>Dragon Ancestor</h4>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor.

Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.<br><br><h4>Draconi⁠c Resilience</h4>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.<br><br>Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.<br><br><h4>Elemental Affinity</h4>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.<br><br><h4>Dragon Wings</h4>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.<br><br><h4>Draconic⁠ Presence</h4>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends.

Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest⁠, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion⁠.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228873/om4ZKNqskJwlz0x5McWK6A/med.png?1527978005\"></div><br><h3>The Cause of Righteousness</h3>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness⁠, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.<br><br>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat⁠, mastering a variety of weapons⁠ and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228952/iaQXte6mMcCafSpNWUHEFg/med.png?1527978052\"></div><br><h3>Beyond the Mundane Life</h3>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring⁠ for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.<br><br>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.<br><br><h3>Creating a Paladin</h3>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy kni⁠ght in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champ⁠ion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shado⁠w, a k⁠night whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Many deities are worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.<br><br>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home, perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.<br><br>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignm⁠ent colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alig⁠nment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions.

You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.<br><br>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.<br><br><h3>Fighting Style</h3>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.<br><br><h4>Defense</h4>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br><br><h4>Dueling</h4>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.<br><br><h4>Great Weapon Fighting</h4>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spe⁠lls of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spe⁠lls.<br><br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin s⁠pells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br><h4>Spellcastin⁠g Ability</h4>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Char⁠isma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Chari⁠sma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier</div><br><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>You can use a holy symbo⁠l as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.<br><br><h3>Divine Smite</h3>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.<br><br><h3>Divine Health</h3>By 3rd level, the divine mag⁠ic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.<br><br><h3>Sacred Oath</h3>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.<br><br>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.<br><br><h4>Oath Spells</h4>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spell⁠s at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spell⁠s don’t count against the number of spell⁠s you can prepare each day.<br><br>If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.<br><br><h4>Channel Divinity</h4>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.<br><br>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br><br>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Extra Attack</h3>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br><br><h3>Aura of Protection</h3>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.<br><br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.<br><br><h3>Aura of Courage</h3>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.<br><br>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.<br><br><h3>Improved Divine Smite</h3>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.<br><br><h3>Cleansing Touch</h3>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h2>Sacred Oaths</h2>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.<br><br><strong>Breaking Your Oath</strong><br>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.<br><br>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.<br><br>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>.<br><br><h2>Subclasses</h2><p></p><ul><li>@Item[Oath of Devotion]</li><li>@Item[Oath of the Ancients]</li><li>@Item[Oath of Vengeance]</li></ul><p>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p><ul><li>@Item[Oath of Conquest]</li><li>@Item[Oath of Redemption]</li></ul><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

We approached our destination without issue, but as we arrived at the burned-out building, a sudden cacophony erupted around us. Birds squawked, cats hissed, and dogs growled. Lidda hustled us back to the city’s safer avenues. Only when we were back within the area patrolled by the guard did she explain that the noises indicated that the wingless folk had claimed that area, and that to trespass would be to court death.</em><br>—Gimble, <em>Notes from a Treasure Hunter</em></blockquote>\n\n<br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/24069869/JPDZTkeUEtZPYSThwmo1Kg/med.png?1476220173\"></div>Haunted by an ancient crime that robbed them of their wings, the kenku wander the world as vagabonds and burglars who live at the edge of human society. Kenku suffer from a sinister reputation that is not wholly unearned, but they can prove to be valuable allies.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>An Ancient Curse</h2>\nThe kenku once served a mysterious, powerful entity on another plane of existence. Some believe they were minions of Grazz’t, while others say that they were scouts and explorers for the Wind Dukes of Aaqa. Whatever the truth, according to legend, the kenku betrayed their master. Unable to resist the lure of a beautiful sparkling treasure, the kenku plotted to steal the item and escape to the Material Plane.\n\t<br><br>Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku’s beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane.\n\t<br><br>Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Dreams of Flight</h2>\n\tAbove all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves.\n\t<br><br>Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places. Even so, their light weight and size allow them to dwell in rickety structures that would collapse beneath a human or an orc.\n\t<br><br>Some thieves’ guilds use kenku as lookouts and messengers. The kenku dwell in the tallest buildings and towers the guild controls, allowing them to lurk in the highest levels and to keep watch on the city below.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Hopeless Plagiarists</h2>\n\tAs a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting long-term schemes.\n\t<br><br>Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a half­ling’s voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside. However, kenku cannot create new sounds and can communicate only by using sounds they have heard. Most kenku use a combination of overheard phrases and sound effects to convey their ideas and thoughts.\n\t<br><br>By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Ideal Minions</h2>\nKenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master.\n\t<br><br>Although kenku can’t create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts. A kenku who learns of clever schemes and plans devised by other creatures can put them to use. The kenku lack the talent to improvise or alter a plan, but a wise Master sets multiple plans in motion at once, confident that underlings can follow orders to the letter.\n\t<br><br>For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves’ guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels. A network of kenku can relay a bird call or similar noise across the city, alerting their allies to the approach of a guard patrol or signaling a prime opportunity for a robbery.\n\t<br><br>Since kenku can precisely reproduce any sound, the messages they carry rarely suffer degradation or shifts in meaning. Human messengers might switch words or phrases and garble a message inadvertently, but the kenku produce perfect copies of whatever they hear.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Kenku Adventurers</h2>\n\tKenku adventurers are usually the survivors of a flock that has sustained heavy losses, or a rare kenku who has grown weary of a life of crime. These kenku are more ambitious and daring than their fellows. Others strike out on their own in search of the secrets of flight, to master magic, or to uncover the secret of their curse and find a method to break it.\n\t<br><br>Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Kenku Names</h2>\n\tGiven that kenku can duplicate any sound, their names are drawn from a staggering variety of noises and phrases. Kenku names tend to break down into three categories that make no distinction between male and female names.\n\t<br><br>Kenku thugs, warriors, and toughs adopt noises made by weapons, such as the clang of a mace against armor or the sound made by a breaking bone. Non-kenku refer to the kenku by describing this noise. Examples of this type of name include Smasher, Clanger, Slicer, and Basher.\n\t<br><br>Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings. In this manner, kenku can call out to each other while those who overhear them mistake them for common animals. Non-kenku use names that refer to the sound made or the animal a kenku mimics, such as Rat Scratch, Whistler, Mouser, and Growler.\n\t<br><br>Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft. A sailor duplicates the sound of a fluttering sail, while a smith mimics the clanging of a hammer on metal. Non-kenku describe these folk by their trade sounds, such as Sail Snap, Hammerer, and Cutter.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Kenku Traits</h2>\nYour kenku character has the following racial traits.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em> </strong>Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em> </strong>Kenku have shorter lifespans than humans. They reach maturity at about 12 years old and can live to 60.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em> </strong>Kenku are chaotic creatures, rarely making enduring commitments, and they care mostly for preserving their own hides. They are generally chaotic neutral in outlook.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em> </strong>Kenku are around 5 feet tall and weigh between 90 and 120 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em> </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Expert Forgery.</em> </strong>You can duplicate other creatures’ handwriting and craftwork. You have advantage on all checks made to produce forgeries or duplicates of existing objects.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Kenku Training.</em> </strong>You are proficient in your choice of two of the following skills: Acrobatics, Deception, Stealth, and Sleight of Hand.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Mimicry.</em> </strong>You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check opposed by your Charisma (Deception) check.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can read and write Common and Auran, but you can speak only by using your Mimicry trait.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>4'4\"</td><td>50 lb.</td><td>+2d8</td><td>× (1d6) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n\n<h2>Roleplaying a Kenku</h2>\n\tIf you’re playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic noises can come across as confusing or irritating rather than entertaining. You can just as easily describe the sounds your character makes and what they mean. Be clear about your character’s intentions unless you’re deliberately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious.\n\t<br><br>You might say, <em>“Snapper makes the noise of a hammer slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the Lords’ Alliance agent sitting at the bar.”</em> Creating a vocabulary of noises for the other players to decode might sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow down the game.","img":""}

The city-state of Draconia rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn Variants</span></h3><p>You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn variants.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104304978/6jtE1g_AWtpsFHcJPJDUzQ/original.png?1581353176\"><br></p><h4>Dragonborn Variant:&nbsp;Ravenite</h4><p>Ravenites have no tails and a hearty physique.

Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur.</p><p>Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment.</p><p>Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.<br><br><h2>A Broad Spectrum</h2>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common⁠ races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood⁠ in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.<br><br><h2>Variety in All Things</h2>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common⁠ races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory. They live fully in the present—making them well suited to the adventuring life—but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55083100/_expHZJhyHaDj4B2XymqIQ/med.png?1527808697\"></div><br><strong>Everyone’s Second-Best Friends</strong><br>Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.<br><br><strong><em>Dwarves.</em></strong> “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”<br><br><strong><em>Elves.</em></strong> “It’s best not to wander into elven woods. They don’t like intruders, and you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows⁠. Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them.”<br><br><strong><em>Halflings. </em></strong>“It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home, as long as you don’t crack your head on the ceiling—good food and good stories in front of a nice, warm fire. If halflings⁠ had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”<br><br><h2>Lasting Institutions</h2>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special⁠ location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling⁠ elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death’s clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.<br><br>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.<br><br><h2>Exemplars of Ambition</h2>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion⁠ causes rather than territories or groups.<br><br><h3>Human Names and Ethnicities</h3>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.<br><br>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics⁠, though, vary according to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and features.<br><br>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely recognized, though over a dozen others are found in more localized areas of Faerûn. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.<br><br><h3>Calishite</h3>Shorter and slighter in build than most other humans, Calishites have dusky brown skin, hair, and eyes. They’re found primarily in southwest Faerûn.<br><br><strong>Calishite Names:</strong> (Male) Aseir, Bardeid, Haseid, Khemed, Mehmen, Sudeiman, Zasheir; (female) Atala, Ceidil, Hama, Jasmal, Meilil, Seipora, Yasheira, Zasheida; (surnames) Basha, Dumein, Jassan, Khalid, Mostana, Pashar, Rein<br><br><h3>Chondathan</h3>Chondathans are slender, tawny-skinned folk with brown hair that ranges from almost blond to almost black. Most are tall and have green or brown eyes, but these traits are hardly universal. Humans of Chondathan descent dominate the central lands of Faerûn, around the Inner Sea.<br><br><strong>Chondathan Names:</strong> (Male) Darvin, Dorn, Evendur, Gorstag, Grim, Helm, Malark, Morn, Randal, Stedd; (female) Arveene, Esvele, Jhessail, Kerri, Lureene, Miri, Rowan, Shandri, Tessele; (surnames) Amblecrown, Buckman, Dundragon, Evenwood, Greycastle, Tallstag<br><br><h3>Damaran</h3>Found primarily in the northwest of Faerûn, Damarans are of moderate height and build, with skin hues ranging from tawny to fair. Their hair is usually brown or black, and their eye color varies widely, though brown is most common⁠.<br><br><strong>Damaran Names: </strong>(Male) Bor, Fodel, Glar, Grigor, Igan, Ivor, Kosef, Mival, Orel, Pavel, Sergor; (female) Alethra, Kara, Katernin, Mara, Natali, Olma, Tana, Zora; (surnames) Bersk, Chernin, Dotsk, Kulenov, Marsk, Nemetsk, Shemov, Starag<br><br><h3>Illuskan</h3>Illuskans are tall, fair-skinned folk with blue or steely gray eyes. Most have raven-black hair, but those who inhabit the extreme northwest have blond, red, or light brown hair.<br><br><strong>Illuskan Names: </strong>(Male) Ander, Blath, Bran, Frath, Geth, Lander, Luth, Malcer, Stor, Taman, Urth; (female) Amafrey, Betha, Cefrey, Kethra, Mara, Olga, Silifrey, Westra; (surnames) Brightwood, Helder, Hornraven, Lackman, Stormwind, Windrivver<br><br><h3>Mulan</h3>Dominant in the eastern and southeastern shores of the Inner Sea, the Mulan are generally tall, slim, and amber-skinned, with eyes of hazel or brown. Their hair ranges from black to dark brown, but in the lands where the Mulan are most prominent, nobles and many other Mulan shave off all their hair.<br><br><strong>Mulan Names:</strong> (Male) Aoth, Bareris, Ehput-Ki, Kethoth, Mumed, Ramas, So-Kehur, Thazar-De, Urhur; (female) Arizima, Chathi, Nephis, Nulara, Murithi, Sefris, Thola, Umara, Zolis; (surnames) Ankhalab, Anskuld, Fezim, Hahpet, Nathandem, Sepret, Uuthrakt<br><br><h3>Rashemi</h3>Most often found east of the Inner Sea and often intermingled with the Mulan, Rashemis tend to be short, stout, and muscular.

In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.<br><br>Rogues rely on skill, stealth⁠, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230375/GTzxCdapvnGMQXypitBReA/med.png?1527979067\"></div><br><h3>Skill and Precision</h3>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat⁠ abilities⁠, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth⁠ and deception, while others refine the ski⁠lls that help them in a dungeon environm⁠ent, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.<br><br>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute stren⁠gth. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the at⁠tack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities⁠.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230801/13uhHo5wimcLe5rSGqVI_w/med.png?1527979466\"></div><br><h3>A Shady Living</h3>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.<br><br>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in sea⁠ch of treasure⁠.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230690/tERx6zMOVnikSFbyq40yCA/med.png?1527979390\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Rogue</h3>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal⁠ past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in sea⁠rch of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or ideal?<br><br>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to emphasize deception and social interaction.

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.<br><br>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.<br><br><h3>Sneak Attack</h3>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the atta⁠ck roll. The atta⁠ck must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.<br><br>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attac⁠k roll.<br><br>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.<br><br><h3>Thieves’ Cant</h3>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message⁠ than it does to speak the same idea plainly.<br><br>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.<br><br><h3>Cunning Action</h3>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.<br><br><h3>Roguish Archetype</h3>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Uncanny Dodge</h3>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.<br><br><h3>Evasion</h3>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an <em>ice storm</em> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.<br><br><h3>Reliable Talent</h3>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.<br><br><h3>Blindsense</h3>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.<br><br><h3>Slippery Mind</h3>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.<br><br><h3>Elusive</h3>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.<br><br><h3>Stroke of Luck</h3>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230869/fQIzUxRlbXEkiziv_xNH6g/med.png?1527979514\"></div><br><h2>Roguish Archetypes</h2>Rogues have many features in com⁠mon, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes.

You perform a special⁠ alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a different one of those materials.&nbsp;For each 10 minutes you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of material.

You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.<br><br><h4>Create Thrall</h4>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a <em>remove curse</em> spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again.<br><br>You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.","img":""}

Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.</p><p>Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.</p><p>The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Names</span></h3><p>Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Traits</span></h3><p>A genasi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b>&nbsp;Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b>&nbsp;Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b>&nbsp;Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Languages.&nbsp;</i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.</p><p><b><i>Subraces.</i></b>&nbsp;There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4>Water Genasi</h4><p>The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—these things call to your heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.</p><p>Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;</i></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Acid Resistance.&nbsp;</i></b>You have resistance to acid damage.</p><p><b><i>Amphibious.&nbsp;</i></b>You can breathe air and water.</p><p><b><i>Swim.&nbsp;</i></b>You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Call to the Wave.</i></b>&nbsp;You know the&nbsp;<i>shape water</i>&nbsp;cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast&nbsp;<i>create or destroy water</i>&nbsp;as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest.

The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.<br><br>  Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponents’ attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters’ magical energy against them.<br><br>  In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.

In its stored form, this energy is called a power surge.<br><br>  You can store a maximum number of power surges equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one.

In addition, you can cast it by spending 2 sorcery points or by expending a spell slot. If you cast it with sorcery points, you can see through the darkness created by the spell.<br><br><h4>Strength of the Grave</h4>Starting at 1st level, your existence in a twilight state between life and death makes you difficult to defeat. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Charisma saving throw (DC 5 + the damage taken). On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point.

On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.<br><br><h4>Shadow Walk</h4>At 14th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness.<br><br><h4>Umbral Form</h4>Starting at 18th level, you can spend 6 sorcery points as a bonus action to magically transform yourself into a shadowy form. In this form, you have resistance to all damage except force and radiant damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object.<br><br>  You remain in this form for 1 minute.

Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane.\n\t<br><br>The tritons, driven by a sense of duty and responsibility, would not allow their foes to escape so easily. A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies.\n\t<br><br>Those tritons spread across the world’s oceans and established protectorates to watch over deep sea trenches, portals, undersea caves, and other locations where their enemies might lurk. They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding.\n\t<br><br>With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Haughty Nobles</h2>\n\tAs a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference.\n\t<br><br>This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons’ great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them.\n\t<br><br>Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons’ limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons’ role as the world’s true protectors.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\n\n<h2>Staunch Champions</h2>\n\tDespite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.\n\t<br><br>Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.\n\t<br><br>At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.<br><br>\n\t\n\t\n\n<h2>Strangers to the Surface</h2>\n\tGiven their isolation, most tritons have never been to the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they can’t easily move up and down out of water, and the changing of the seasons mystifies them.\n\t<br><br>Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world. The typical triton protectorate is tightly regimented, organized, and unified around a common cause. A triton on the surface becomes easily confused by the bewildering array of alliances, rivalries, and petty grievances that prevent the surface folk from truly unifying.\n\t<br><br>At its worst, a triton’s arrogance compounds the tendency for the triton not to understand the ways of the surface world. It’s easy for a triton to blame baffling social practices on what the triton perceives as the barbarism, weakness, or cowardice of surface folk.<br><br>\n\n\t\n\n<h2>Triton Personality</h2>\n\tFar from flawless, these champions of good mean well, but they are easily frustrated by others. You can select, roll, or adapt a triton-specific quirk from the Triton Quirks table. Use the quirk to inform how you portray your character.\n\n\t<br><br><h5>Triton Quirks</h5>\n\t<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d6</strong></td><td><strong>Quirk</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>You phrase requests as orders that you expect to be obeyed.<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You are quick to boast of the greatness of your civilization.<br></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You learned an antiquated version of Common and drop “thee” and “thou” into your speech.<br></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>You assume that people are telling you the truth about local customs and expectations.<br></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>The surface world is a wondrous place, and you catalog all its details in a journal.<br></td></tr><tr><td>6 &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You mistakenly assume that surface folk know about and are impressed by your people’s history.</td></tr></tbody></table><br>\n\t\n\n\n<h2>Triton Names</h2>\n\tMost triton names have two or three syllables. Male names typically end with a vowel and the letter s, and female names traditionally end with an n. Tritons use their home protectorate as a surname, with the name formed by adding a vowel followed by a “th” to the end of the protectorate’s name.\n\t<br><br><strong>Female Triton Names:</strong> Aryn, Belthyn, Duthyn, Feloren, Otanyn, Shalryn, Vlaryn, Wolyn\n\t<br><br><strong>Male Triton Names:</strong> Corus, Delnis, Jhimas, Keros, Molos, Nalos, Vodos, Zunis\n\t<br><br><strong>Triton Surnames:</strong> Ahlorsath, Pumanath, Vuuvaxath<br><br>\n\t\n\t\n\n<h2>Triton Traits</h2>\n\tYour triton character has the following racial traits.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength, Constitution, and Charisma scores each increase by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Tritons reach maturity around age 15 and can live up to 200 years.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Tritons tend toward lawful good. As guardians of the darkest reaches of the sea, their culture pushes them toward order and benevolence.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Tritons are slightly shorter than humans, averaging about 5 feet tall. Your size is Medium.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> You can breathe air and water.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Control Air and Water.</em></strong> A child of the sea, you can call on the magic of elemental air and water. You can cast fog cloud with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast <em>Gust of Wind</em> with it, and starting at 5th level, you can also cast <em>Wall of Water</em> with it. Once you cast a spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Emissary of the Sea.</em></strong> Aquatic beasts have an extraordinary affinity with your people. You can communicate simple ideas with beasts that can breathe water. They can understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Guardians of the Depths.</em></strong> Adapted to even the most extreme ocean depths, you have resistance to cold damage, and you ignore any of the drawbacks caused by a deep, underwater environment.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>4'6\"</td><td>90 lb.</td><td>+2d10</td><td>× (2d4) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>","img":""}

Shaped by draconic⁠ gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.<br><br><h2>Proud Dragon Kin</h2>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.<br><br>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.<br><br><h2>Self-Sufficient Clans</h2>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.<br><br>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.<br><br>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55084508/KYQtN52vDjYBMDQLGhS-Rg/med.png?1527809251\"></div><br><h2>Dragonborn Names</h2>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their clan names first as a mark of honor.

For example, humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn’t think, “I’m scared.” Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren’t scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can’t be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on.\n\t<br><br>Pleasurable people and things make life easier for lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk’s own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cold and Calculating</h2>\n\tMost humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of lizardfolk.<br><br><h5></h5>Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don’t mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.\n\t<br><br>A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures’ emotions. The lizardfolk doesn’t share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Utility and Survival</h2>\n\tThe lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, without sentiment.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hapless Soft Ones</h2>\n\tAt their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it’s a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps.\n\t<br><br>Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lizardfolk Personality</h2>\n\tYou can use the Lizardfolk Quirks table to determine a personality quirk for a lizardfolk character or to inspire a unique mannerism.<br><br>\n\n<h5>Lizardfolk Quirks</h5><table><tbody><tr><td><strong></strong>d8&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Quirk</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>You hate waste and see no reason not to scavenge fallen enemies.

They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual’s notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as “axe,” a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe’s weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means “green” to describe how she blends into the foliage.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and female in their naming conventions. Each example name includes its translation in parenthesis.\n\t<br><br><strong>Lizardfolk Names:</strong> Achuak (green), Aryte (war), Baeshra (animal), Darastrix (dragon), Garurt (axe), Irhtos (secret), Jhank (hammer), Kepesk (storm), Kethend (gem), Korth (danger), Kosj (small), Kothar (demon), Litrix (armor), Mirik (song), Othokent (smart), Sauriv (eye), Throden (many), Thurkear (night), Usk (iron), Valignat (burn), Vargach (battle), Verthica (mountain), Vutha (black), Vyth (steel)<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lizardfolk Traits</h2>\n\tYour lizardfolk character has the following racial traits.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em> </strong>Lizardfolk reach maturity around age 14 and rarely live longer than 60 years.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em> </strong>Most lizardfolk are neutral. They see the world as a place of predators and prey, where life and death are natural processes. They wish only to survive, and prefer to leave other creatures to their own devices.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em> </strong>Lizardfolk are a little bulkier and taller than humans, and their colorful frills make them appear even larger. Your size is Medium.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em> </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet, and you have a swimming speed of 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Cunning Artisan.</em></strong> As part of a short rest, you can harvest bone and hide from a slain beast, construct, dragon, monstrosity, or plant creature of size Small or larger to create one of the following items: a shield, a club, a javelin, or 1d4 darts or blowgun needles. To use this trait, you need a blade, such as a dagger, or appropriate artisan’s tools, such as leatherworker’s tools.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Hold Breath.</em></strong> You can hold your breath for up to 15 minutes at a time.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Hunter’s Lore.</em></strong> You gain proficiency with two of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Natural Armor.</em></strong> You have tough, scaly skin. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield’s benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Hungry Jaws.</em> </strong>In battle, you can throw yourself into a vicious feeding frenzy. As a bonus action, you can make a special attack with your bite. If the attack hits, it deals its normal damage, and you gain temporary hit points (minimum of 1) equal to your Constitution modifier, and you can’t use this trait again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em> </strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>4'9\"</td><td>120 lb.</td><td>+2d10</td><td>× (2d6) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lizardfolk Speech</h2>\n\tLizardfolk can master Common, but their mindset results in a speech pattern distinct from other humanoids.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk rarely use metaphors. Their speech is almost always literal. They might pick up idioms, but only with some difficulty.\n\t<br><br>Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words.\n\t<br><br>Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A lizardfolk in cold weather might say, “This wind brings cold” rather than “I feel cold.” Lizardfolk tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.","img":""}

More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.<br><br>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55133673/tIjcMendmlvD43_1WNnOPA/med.png?1527878627\"></div><br><h3>Primal Instinct</h3>People of towns and cities⁠ take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.<br><br>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat⁠. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman stre⁠ngth and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting⁠, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.<br><br><h3>A Life of Danger</h3>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled⁠ fighter⁠ in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.<br><br>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring⁠ parties.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55227020/KWV-62boqK1GF9HnUySYkw/med.png?1527976711\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Barbarian</h3>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land, making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?<br><br>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to “civilized” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of authority.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.

Having such a blessed soul is a sign that your innate magic might come from a distant but powerful familial connection to a divine being. Perhaps your ancestor was an angel, transformed into a mortal and sent to fight in a god’s name. Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.<br><br>  A Divine Soul, with a natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands sacred power, a Divine Soul can undermine an existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.<br><br>  In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power. In these lands, ecclesiastical positions are dominated by a few bloodlines and preserved over generations.<br><br><strong>Divine Soul Features</strong><table>\n<thead><tr><th><br></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td><b>Sorcerer Level</b></td><td><b>Feature</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Divine Magic, Favored by the Gods</td></tr>\n <tr><td>6th</td><td>Empowered Healing</td></tr>\n <tr><td>14th</td><td>Otherworldly Wings</td></tr>\n <tr><td>18th</td><td>Unearthly Recovery</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><h4>Divine Magic</h4>Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells from the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.<br><br>  In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn’t count against your number of sorcerer spells known.

Whenever you or an ally within 5 feet of you rolls dice to determine the number of hit points a spell restores, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll any number of those dice once, provided you aren’t incapacitated. You can use this feature only once per turn.<br><br><h4>Otherworldly Wings</h4>Starting at 14th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest a pair of spectral wings from your back. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. The wings last until you’re incapacitated, you die, or you dismiss them as a bonus action.<br>  <br>The affinity you chose for your Divine Magic feature determines the appearance of the spectral wings: eagle wings for good or law, bat wings for evil or chaos, and dragonfly wings for neutrality.<br><br><h4>Unearthly Recovery</h4>At 18th level, you gain the ability to overcome grievous injuries.

The city-state of Draconia rose in the Dreemoth Ravine along the southern edge of the continent, when foreign dragonkin fleeing the gods’ wrath during the Calamity forged an alliance with native dragonborn already dwelling there. The colonizing dragonborn, who called themselves draconbloods, worked with the native dragonborn, called ravenites, to build a society that could withstand the wandering monsters of Xhorhas. However, Draconia swiftly descended into corruption and bigotry, and the draconblood ruling class betrayed and enslaved their ravenite kin.</p><p>Twenty years ago, Draconia was destroyed by the ire of the mighty Chroma Conclave, and the city-state’s ruins were occupied by an ancient white dragon named Vorugal. The chaos of the attack upended draconblood civilization, and the ravenite slaves rose up and drove their former masters from the Dreemoth Ravine. Now masters of their own fate, the ravenite dragonborn have rebuilt their home within the ravine and have begun to spread out across the world.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn Variants</span></h3><p>You can allow a player to choose one of the following dragonborn variants.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104304966/MY3YDH1OGtHmZ7ICKeHhrQ/original.png?1581353166\"><br></p><h4>Dragonborn Variant:&nbsp;Draconblood</h4><p>Draconbloods possess long tails and a knack for social manipulation. They remember the days when they were once mighty conquerors.</p><p>A draconblood uses the dragonborn traits in the&nbsp;<i>Player’s Handbook</i>, with the following traits replacing the Ability Score Increase and Damage Resistance traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.&nbsp;</i></b>Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b>&nbsp;You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.

Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.<br></p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>The Dwendalian Empire has seen a massive influx of dragonborn since the fall of Draconia. Most of the draconblood nobles who fled into the empire tried to use their grandiloquent names and titles to earn favors and prestige. But without the power of a nation-state behind them, many of those former slave owners were forced into lives of farming or hard labor. Some in the empire speak in awed whispers of the “former dragonborn princes” who now live as paupers, while others scoff at these haughty dragonborn’s delusions of grandeur.</p><p>Many ravenites have journeyed to the Dwendalian Empire in the years since the death of Vorugal, but the first of those found a colder reception than was given their former masters. The empire had no desire to grant asylum to revolutionaries, and would have turned the ravenites away had the Cerberus Assembly not intervened. For reasons unknown, the Assembly created the shantytown of Talonstadt for displaced ravenites, allowing them to trade labor for lodging there.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Many of the draconbloods fleeing their ruined city-state settled among the people of the Clovis Concord. Some had beach homes and private villas to flee to, and were able to establish businesses with the money they had stashed away there. Others were not so fortunate, and were forced to take menial jobs to make ends meet. Many residents of the Clovis Concord feel a twinge of sympathy for the draconblood exiles, but most commoners who have any knowledge of the ravenite uprising see this life of servitude as just punishment.</p><p>Many of the ravenites who travel to the warm sands of the coast are merchants or wealthy generals or politicians on vacation. As such, all ravenites on the Menagerie Coast are assumed to have wealth—even exiles or penniless adventurers. Any tailless dragonborn who wanders through the cities of the Clovis Concord must constantly fend off hucksters, peddlers, and thieves.</p><hr><h3><span>Dragonborn in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Countless draconbloods fled into the wastes of Xhorhas in search of asylum, and some even dared approach the intimidating walls of Rosohna. The dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty were eager to welcome these formerly isolated people into their ranks—though their reasons for doing so were less than altruistic. More dragonborn living within range of the Luxon’s beacons deepens the well of experiences that drow engaged in anamnesis can draw from, bringing their people closer to true enlightenment. The dark elves have no interest in the rift between the draconbloods and the ravenites, and treat both peoples as equals.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

They are as hard and unforgiving as the mountain stone, as cold and pitiless as its bitter, cold winds. If you approach them in strength, they might consider you worthy of an alliance.</em><br>—Tordek, <em>A Guide to the Peaks</em></blockquote>\n\n<br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/24069816/lbBBUoVvWu3xnOfN6RI2uw/med.png?1476219966\"></div>At the highest mountain peaks—far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl—dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with one. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Driven Competitors&nbsp;</h2>\nEvery day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual’s heroic effort can ensure the entire group’s survival.<br><br>Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.<br><br>This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Fair Play</h2>\nFor goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.\n\t<br><br>This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society’s structures or rules to maintain power.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Survival of the Fittest</h2>\n\tAmong goliaths, any adult who can’t contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can’t take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.\n\t<br><br>A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.\n\t<br><br>In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.\n\t<br><br>Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by long-term leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Goliath Names</h2>\n\tEvery goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn’s mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.\n\t<br><br>Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.\n\t<br><br>A goliath’s nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual’s notable deeds.\n\t<br><br>Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.\n\t<br><br><strong>Birth Names:</strong> Aukan, Eglath, Gae-Al, Gauthak, Ilikan, Keothi, Kuori, Lo-Kag, Manneo, Maveith, Nalla, Orilo, Paavu, Pethani, Thalai, Thotham, Uthal, Vaunea, Vimak\n\t<br><br><strong>Nicknames: </strong>Bearkiller, Dawncaller, Fearless, Flintfinder, Horncarver, Keeneye, Lonehunter, Longleaper, Rootsmasher, Skywatcher, Steadyhand, Threadtwister, Twice-Orphaned, Twistedlimb, Wordpainter\n\t<br><br><strong>Clan Names:</strong> Anakalathai, Elanithino, Gathakanathi, Kalagiano, Katho-Olavi, Kolae-Gileana, Ogolakanu, Thuliaga, Thunukalathi, Vaimei-Laga\n<br><br>\n\n\n<h2>Goliath Traits</h2>\nGoliaths share a number of traits in common with each other.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em> </strong>Goliaths have lifespans comparable to humans. They enter adulthood in their late teens and usually live less than a century.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em> </strong>Goliath society, with its clear roles and tasks, has a strong lawful bent. The goliath sense of fairness, balanced with an emphasis on self-sufficiency and personal accountability, pushes them toward neutrality.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em> </strong>Goliaths are between 7 and 8 feet tall and weigh between 280 and 340 pounds. Your size is Medium.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em> </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Natural Athlete.</em> </strong>You have proficiency in the Athletics skill.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Stone’s Endurance.</em></strong> You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Powerful Build.</em> </strong>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Mountain Born.</em></strong> You’re acclimated to high altitude, including elevations above 20,000 feet.

The mighty sword <em>Blackrazor</em> is the most notable of these weapons, which have been spread across the multiverse over the ages. The shadowy force behind these weapons can offer power to warlocks who form pacts with it. Many hexblade warlocks create weapons that emulate those formed in the Shadowfell. Others forgo such arms, content to weave the dark magic of that plane into their spellcasting.<br><br>  Because the Raven Queen is known to have forged the first of these weapons, many sages speculate that she and the force are one and that the weapons, along with hexblade warlocks, are tools she uses to manipulate events on the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.<br><br><strong>Hexblade Features</strong><table>\n<thead><tr><th><br></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td><b>Warlock Level</b></td><td><b>Feature</b></td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>Expanded Spell List, Hexblade's Curse, Hex Warrior</td></tr>\n <tr><td>6th</td><td>Accursed Specter</td></tr>\n <tr><td>10th</td><td>Armor of Hexes</td></tr>\n <tr><td>14th</td><td>Master of Hexes</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><h4>Expanded Spell List</h4>The Hexblade lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a specter, the statistics for which are in the <em>Monster Manual</em>. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns.

If the target cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll a d6. On a 4 or higher, the attack instead misses you, regardless of its roll.<br><br><h4>Master of Hexes</h4>Starting at 14th level, you can spread your Hexblade’s Curse from a slain creature to another creature. When the creature cursed by your Hexblade’s Curse dies, you can apply the curse to a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you, provided you aren’t incapacitated.

Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves⁠ are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.<br><br>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common⁠ shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves⁠ value their beards highly and groom them carefully.<br><br><h2>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h2>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves⁠ living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.<br><br>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves⁠, who uphold the dwarven ideals⁠ of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.<br><br>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves⁠ have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.<br><br><h2>Clans and Kingdoms</h2>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves⁠ this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth⁠ they can’t find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.<br><br>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves⁠ who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves⁠, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.<br><br>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55070759/KUNS71Izc5YSvqSpk8ZMaQ/med.png?1527796858\"></div><br><h2>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h2>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves⁠ are driven by the command⁠ or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled.

No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer⁠ meets the orc’s head, they’re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword. They’re flighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though: They don’t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very fine work. And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an elf’s good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”<br><br><strong><em>Halflings.</em></strong> “Sure, they’re pleasant folk. But show me a halfling hero. An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure⁠ for the ages made by halfling⁠ hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?”<br><br><strong><em>Humans.</em></strong> “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed. If you’re lucky, she’s got kin—a daughter or granddaughter, maybe—who’s got hands and heart as good as hers. That’s when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it’s a dragon’s hoard or an empire’s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”<br><br><h2>Dwarf Names</h2>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its place.<br><br><strong>Male Names:</strong> Adrik, Alberich, Baern, Barendd, Brottor, Bruenor, Dain, Darrak, Delg, Eberk, Einkil, Fargrim, Flint, Gardain, Harbek, Kildrak, Morgran, Orsik, Oskar, Rangrim, Rurik, Taklinn, Thoradin, Thorin, Tordek, Traubon, Travok, Ulfgar, Veit, Vondal<br><br><strong>Female Names:</strong> Amber, Artin, Audhild, Bardryn, Dagnal, Diesa, Eldeth, Falkrunn, Finellen, Gunnloda, Gurdis, Helja, Hlin, Kathra, Kristryd, Ilde, Liftrasa, Mardred, Riswynn, Sannl, Torbera, Torgga, Vistra<br><br><strong>Clan Names:</strong> Balderk, Battlehammer, Brawnanvil, Dankil, Fireforge, Frostbeard, Gorunn, Holderhek, Ironfist, Loderr, Lutgehr, Rumnaheim, Strakeln, Torunn, Ungart<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55220349/EyyJ64_wI07E8-AcwkrpqQ/med.png?1527971343\"></div><br><h2>Dwarf Traits</h2>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Constitution score increases by 2.<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered young until they reach the age of 50.

Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55237310/SDFEJ-JiaQbpKsZ3VvJwNg/med.png?1527981581\"></div><br><h3>Sworn and Beholden</h3>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric⁠ and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.<br><br>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness⁠ or to read any language) to access to powerful spells⁠. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat⁠. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55237465/yA6V_y-Dv6pDl5uKHwMNQQ/med.png?1527981691\"></div><br><h3>Delvers into Secrets</h3>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.<br><br>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends⁠ are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.<br><br>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55237801/53ll4v1F2D5a8wGjMzWUNw/med.png?1527981978\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Warlock</h3>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you sea⁠rch for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?<br><br>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.<br><br>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?<br><br>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the <em>eldritch blast</em> and <em>chill touch</em> cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells <em>charm person</em> and <em>witch bolt</em>.<br><br><strong>The Warlock</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Level</td><td>Proficiency<br>Bonus</td><td>Features</td><td>Cantrips<br>Known</td><td>Spells<br>Known</td><td>Spell<br>Slots</td><td>Slot<br>Leve⁠l</td><td>Invocations<br>Known</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Otherworldly Patron, Pact Magic</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1st</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Eldritch Invocations</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1st</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Pact Boon</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2nd</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>—</td><td>3</td><td>6</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Otherworldly Patron feature</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>3rd</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>—</td><td>3</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>4th</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>4th</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>—</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>5th</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Otherworldly Patron feature</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>2</td><td>5th</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Mystic Arcanum (6th level)</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>Mystic Arcanum (7th level)</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Otherworldly Patron feature</td><td>4</td><td>12</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Mystic Arcanum (8th level)</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4</td><td>13</td><td>3</td><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Mystic Arcanum (9th level)</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>—</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Eldritch Master</td><td>4</td><td>15</td><td>4</td><td>5th</td><td>8</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>Class Features</h2>As a warlock, you gain the following class features.<br><br><h4>Hit Points</h4><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>1d8 per warlock level<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level: </strong>8 + your Constitution modifier<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels: </strong>1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st<br><br><h4>Proficiencies</h4><strong>Armor: </strong>Light⁠ armor<br><strong>Weapons: </strong>Simple weapons<br><strong>Tools: </strong>None<br><br><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Wisdom, Charisma<br><strong>Skills: </strong>Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion<br><br><h4>Equipment</h4>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipmen⁠t granted by your background:<br><br><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a component pouch or (<em>b</em>) an arcane focus</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a scholar’s pack or (<em>b</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack</li><li>Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li></ul><h3>Otherworldly Patron</h3>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.<br><br><h3>Pact Magic</h3>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. See the general rules of spellcasting and the warlock spell list.<br><br><h4>Cantrip⁠s</h4>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantr⁠ips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantri⁠ps Known column of the Warlock table.<br><br><h4>Spell Slots</h4>The Warlock table shows how many spe⁠ll slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell <em>witch bolt</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.<br><br><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.<br><br>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells⁠ of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.<br><br>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Ability</h4>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Cha⁠risma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Char⁠isma modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier</div><br><h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.<br><br><h3>Eldritch Invocations</h3>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.<br><br>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.<br><br>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.<br><br><h3>Pact Boon</h3>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.<br><br><h4>Pact of the Chain</h4>You learn the <em>find familiar</em> spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.<br><br>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special⁠ forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.<br><br>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.<br><br><h4>Pact of the Blade</h4>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see Weapons for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<br><br>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.<br><br>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special⁠ ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.<br><br><h4>Pact of the Tome</h4>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book⁠ of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cant⁠rips at will. They don’t count against your number of cant⁠rips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.<br><br>If you lose your Book⁠ of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.<br><br><strong>Your Pact Boon</strong><br>Each Pact Boon option produces a special⁠ creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.<br><br><strong><em>Pact of the Chain⁠. </em></strong>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.<br><br><strong><em>Pact of the Blade. </em></strong>If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.<br><br><strong><em>Pact of the Tome. </em></strong>Your Book⁠ of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells⁠ of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Mystic Arcanum</h3>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.<br><br>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.<br><br>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h3>Eldritch Master</h3>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spe⁠ll slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spe⁠ll slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.<br><br><h2>Otherworldly Patrons</h2>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.<br><br>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.<p></p><ul><li>@Item[The Archfey]</li><li>@Item[The Fiend]</li><li><a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Great Old One#h-Great Old One\">The Great Old One</a></li></ul><p>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p><ul><li>@Item[The Celestial/]</li><li>@Item[The Hexblade]</li></ul>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit⁠ kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons⁠ and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat⁠. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55140993/Sk4SbzK37OqJjxxrGSSkZA/med.png?1527884853\"></div><br><h3>Well-Rounded Specialists</h3>Fighters learn the basics of all combat⁠ styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.<br><br><h3>Trained for Danger</h3>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran⁠ soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.<br><br>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common⁠ among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic <em>flame tongue</em> sword, for example.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55228172/ABMZ84Y1B5Ug_k6ju5J4aA/med.png?1527977582\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Fighter</h3>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character’s background: Where did you get your combat⁠ training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.<br><br>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics⁠, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s embrace.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the soldier background.<br><br><strong>The Fighter</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Level⁠</td><td>Proficiency<br>Bonus</td><td>Features</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Fighting Style, Second Wind</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Action Surge (one use)</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Martial Archetype</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Extra Attack</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Martial Archetype feature</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>Indomitable (one use)</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Martial Archetype feature</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Extra Attack (2)</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>Indomitable (two uses)</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Martial Archetype feature</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable (three uses)</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Martial Archetype feature</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Extra Attack (3)</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>Class Features</h2>As a fighter, you gain the following class features.<br><br><h4>Hit Points</h4><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>1d10 per fighter level<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level: </strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per fighter level after 1st<br><br><h4>Proficiencies</h4><strong>Armor:</strong> All armor, shields<br><strong>Weapons:</strong> Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><strong>Tools:</strong> None<br><br><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Strength, Constitution<br><strong>Skills: </strong>Choose two skills from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival<br><br><h4>Equipment⁠</h4>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment⁠ granted by your background:<br><br><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) chain mail or (<em>b</em>) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a martial weapon and a shield or (<em>b</em>) two martial weapons</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) two handaxes</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li></ul><br><h3>Fighting Style</h3>You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.

In truth, tortles are an ancient and long-lived people who dwell within the jungles and along the beaches of the Menagerie Coast. Most tortles who journey far from the coast begin to feel pangs of homesickness, which can develop into a depression.</p><p>Tortles are almost unheard of beyond the sunny shores of the Menagerie Coast.</p><hr><h3><span>Life of a Tortle</span></h3><p>A tortle hatches from a thick-shelled egg and spends the first few weeks of its life crawling on all fours. Its parents, old and near death, spend what little time they have left telling stories to their offspring. Within a year, the young tortle becomes an orphan, though not before it learns to speak and to survive on its own.</p><p>A young tortle and its siblings inherit whatever tools, weapons, and gifts their parents left behind. Each young tortle is expected to fend for itself. It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills. It forms friendships with its neighbors while also respecting their privacy. At some point, a tortle feels an urge to see more of the world. It gathers up its gear and travels, returning months or years later with stories of its exploits.</p><p>When a tortle nears the end of its lifespan, it seeks out a mate. Tortles lay their eggs (numbering as few as one or as many as a dozen) in a fortified compound. If no such compound exists, they build one. The parents spend the remainder of their lives guarding it, defending their offspring, and sharing their knowledge. When the children grow up, they pick up whatever weapons and tools their parents left behind and set out on their own.</p><hr><h3><span>Tortle Names</span></h3><p>Tortles prefer non-gender-specific names that are usually no more than two syllables. Tortles don’t have surnames or family names.</p><p><b>Male and Female Names:</b> Baka, Damu, Gar, Gura, Ini, Jappa, Kinlek, Krull, Lim, Lop, Nortle, Nulka, Olo, Ploqwat, Quee, Queg, Quott, Sunny, Tibor, Ubo, Uhok, Wabu, Xelbuk, Xopa, Yog</p><hr><h3><span>Tortle Traits</span></h3><p>A tortle character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Young tortles crawl for a few weeks after birth before learning to walk on two legs. They reach adulthood by the age of 15 and live an average of 50 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment. </i></b>Tortles tend to lead orderly, ritualistic lives. They develop routines, becoming more set in their ways as they age. Most are lawful good. A few can be selfish and greedy, tending more toward evil, but it’s unusual for a tortle to shuck off order in favor of chaos.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Tortle adults stand 5 to 6 feet tall and average about 450 pounds. Their shells account for roughly one-third of their weight. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d8<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 10 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 400 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Claws. </i></b>Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><b><i>Hold Breath. </i></b>You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour at a time. Tortles aren’t natural swimmers, but they can remain underwater for some time before needing to come up for air.</p><p><b><i>Natural Armor.</i></b> Due to your shell and the shape of your body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. Your shell provides ample protection, however; it gives you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.</p><p><b><i>Shell Defense.</i></b> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can’t take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p><p><b><i>Survival Instinct. </i></b>You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. Tortles have finely honed survival instincts.</p><p><b><i>Languages.</i></b> You can speak, read, and write Aquan and Common.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner.

Alternatively, you learn one language of your choice.<br><br><h4>Born to the Saddle</h4>Starting at 3rd level, your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if you’re not incapacitated.<br><br>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.<br><br><h4>Unwavering Mark</h4>Starting at 3rd level, you can menace your foes, foiling their attacks and punishing them for harming others. When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can mark the creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or you die, or if someone else marks the creature.<br>While it is within 5 feet of you, a creature marked by you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn’t target you.<br><br>In addition, if a creature marked by you deals damage to anyone other than you, you can make a special melee weapon attack against the marked creature as a bonus action on your next turn. You have advantage on the attack roll, and if it hits, the attack’s weapon deals extra damage to the target equal to half your fighter level.<br>Regardless of the number of creatures you mark, you can make this special attack a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h4>Warding Maneuver</h4>At 7th level, you learn to fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack’s damage.<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h4>Hold the Line</h4>At 10th level, you become a master of locking down your enemies. Creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they move 5 feet or more while within your reach, and if you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the current turn.<br><br><h4>Ferocious Charger</h4>Starting at 15th level, you can run down your foes, whether you’re mounted or not. If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line right before attacking a creature and you hit it with the attack, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.<br><br><h4>Vigilant Defender</h4>Starting at 18th level, you respond to danger with extraordinary vigilance. In combat, you get a special reaction that you can take once on every creature’s turn, except your turn. You can use this special reaction only to make an opportunity attack, and you can’t use it on the same turn that you take your normal reaction.<br><br><h4>Cavaliers, Samurai, and History</h4>While both cavaliers and samurai existed in the real world, our inspirations for both fighter archetypes are taken from popular culture (folk tales, movies, and comic books), not from history. Our intent is to capture the cinematic, heroic element of both archetypes in the game, rather than create an accurate historical representation of either one.","img":""}

The stories vary from realm to realm, but it’s clear that Corellon the Arch Heart wove the elves from grass, Moradin the All-Hammer carved the dwarves from earth, and so on. Halflings across Wildemount have no such stories, and no faiths tell of their god creating the small folk. Some speculate that Avandra the Change Bringer placed halflings in the world, but despite some of Ioun’s most devout priests petitioning their god to reveal the truth of the halflings’ creation, the Knowing Mentor has remained infuriatingly coy on the topic.</p><p>For their part, halflings in the Dwendalian Empire and the Menagerie Coast don’t much care where they came from. All they know is that they walked out of a hole in the ground one day to find a beautiful world spread out before them. Some longed to explore to that world’s farthest horizons, while others were content to gaze upon the beauty of the same sunrise each morning. Plenty of halflings have joined the Cobalt Soul over the years in desperate search of answers to the world’s big questions—where did we come from, and where are we going? But most halflings are content to leave the questions of past and future well enough alone, simply living in the present.</p><hr><h3><span>Halflings in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Generations ago, the halflings of the Felder clan established a settlement now known as Felderwin Tillage, and discovered in time that they had inadvertently created an agricultural powerhouse. The word “halfling” has been synonymous with a simple, rural lifestyle ever since.</p><p>The dutiful, orderly people of the Dwendalian Empire most often think of halflings as carefree country bumpkins. In a nation obsessed with its heritage and its legacy, the stereotypical halfling philosophy of living life in the moment is viewed as pathetically unambitious.</p><hr><h3><span>Halflings on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>People in this part of the world have no real assumptions about halflings. Most perceive them on a level with humans, having similar ambitions, virtues, and vices. The only difference is that halflings are a wee bit smaller from prow to stern and a fair bit bigger from port to starboard.</p><p>Halflings are common enough in the Clovis Concord that just about every vessel, shop, tavern, coffee house, and brothel has been designed with halflings and gnomes in mind. Stairs often have shallow steps for small legs, stools feature hand-cranks to adjust their height up or down, and most restaurants have utensils sized for small hands.</p><hr><h3><span>Halflings in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Few Xhorhasians have ever seen a halfling except for the occasional halfling soldier in Dwendalian armor. Because of this, most Kryn citizens view halflings as icons of the empire and are quick to distrust them. Only the Lotusden halflings, a reclusive and insular clan native to the Lotusden Greenwood, call Xhorhas home.</p><hr><h3><span>Halfling Subraces</span></h3><p>At the DM’s discretion, players have access to the lotusden halfling subrace described below, in addition to the halfling subraces in the Player’s Handbook.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104304950/WCbm-nl8-CevJQblbcuHNQ/original.png?1581353148\"><br></p><h4>Lotusden Halfling</h4><p>Long tied to the natural heart of the Lotusden Greenwood, these halflings have adapted to live synergistically with the chaotic laws of the wilds.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b>&nbsp;Your Wisdom score increases by 1.<br><span><b><i>Child of the Wood.&nbsp;</i></b>You know the&nbsp;<i>druidcraft&nbsp;</i>cantrip.

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins—sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55229375/KrzrKXDUMSEIPpqOxM4fGQ/med.png?1527978275\"></div><br><h4>Tenets of Vengeance</h4>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.<br><br><strong><em>Fight the Greater Evil. </em></strong>Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.<br><br><strong><em>No Mercy for the Wicked. </em></strong>Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.<br><br><strong><em>By Any Means Necessary. </em></strong>My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.<br><br><strong><em>Restitution. </em></strong>If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.<br><br><h4>Oath Spells</h4>You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.<br><br><strong>Oath of Vengeance Spells</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Paladin Level</td><td>Spells</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td><em>bane, hunter's mark</em></td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td><em>hold person, misty step</em></td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td><em>haste, protection from energy</em></td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td><em>banishment, dimension door</em></td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td><em>hold monster, scrying</em></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>Channel Divinity</h4>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.<br><br><strong><em>Abjure Enemy. </em></strong>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.<br><br>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.<br><br>On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.<br><br><strong><em>Vow of Enmity. </em></strong>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.<br><br><h4>Relentles⁠s Avenger</h4>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.<br><br><h4>Soul of Vengeance</h4>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.<br><br><h4>Avenging Angel</h4>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger.

For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:<br><br><ul><li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li><li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

They go much farther than eye rays. That’s why I stay indoors all the time. Besides, the sky is totally overrated.</blockquote></em><div>—Xanathar</div><br>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers are some of the most elite warriors among the elves. They stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements. Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.<br><br><strong>Arcane Archer Features</strong><table>\n<thead><tr><th><br></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody>\n <tr><td><b>Fighter Level</b></td><td><b>Feature</b></td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Arcane Archer Lore, Arcane Shot (2 options)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>7th</td><td>Curving Shot, Magic Arrow, Arcane Shot (3 options)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>10th</td><td>Arcane Shot (4 options)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>15th</td><td>Ever-Ready Shot, Arcane Shot (5 options)</td></tr>\n <tr><td>18th</td><td>Arcane Shot (6 options, improved shots)</td></tr>\n</tbody></table><h4>Arcane Archer Lore</h4>At 3rd level, you learn magical theory or some of the secrets of nature—typical for practitioners of this elven martial tradition. You choose to gain proficiency in either the Arcana or the Nature skill, and you choose to learn either the <em>prestidigitation </em>or the <em>druidcraft</em> cantrip.<br><br><h4>Arcane Shot</h4>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn two Arcane Shot options of your choice (see “Arcane Shot Options” below).<br><br>Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Arcane Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits a creature, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You have two uses of this ability, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.<br><br>You gain an additional Arcane Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.<br><br><h4>Magic Arrow</h4>At 7th level, you gain the ability to infuse arrows with magic. Whenever you fire a nonmagical arrow from a shortbow or longbow, you can make it magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. The magic fades from the arrow immediately after it hits or misses its target.<br><br><h4>Curving Shot</h4>At 7th level, you learn how to direct an errant arrow toward a new target. When you make an attack roll with a magic arrow and miss, you can use a bonus action to reroll the attack roll against a different target within 60 feet of the original target.<br><br><h4>Ever-Ready Shot</h4>Starting at 15th level, your magical archery is available whenever battle starts. If you roll initiative and have no uses of Arcane Shot remaining, you regain one use of it.<br><br><h4>Arcane Shot Options</h4>The Arcane Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in alphabetical order. They are all magical effects, and each one is associated with one of the schools of magic.<br><br>If an option requires a saving throw, your Arcane Shot save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.<br><br><strong><em>Banishing Arrow. </em></strong>You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target’s speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.<br><br>After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes 2d6 force damage when the arrow hits it.<br><br><strong><em>Beguiling Arrow. </em></strong>Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it is charmed by the chosen ally until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally attacks the charmed target, deals damage to it, or forces it to make a saving throw.<br><br>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Bursting Arrow.</em></strong> You imbue your arrow with force energy drawn from the school of evocation. The energy detonates after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 force damage each.<br><br>The force damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Enfeebling Arrow. </em></strong>You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.<br><br>The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Grasping Arrow.</em></strong> When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.<br><br>The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Piercing Arrow.</em></strong> You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow shoots forward in a line, which is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.<br><br>The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Seeking Arrow. </em></strong>Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out a target. When you use this option, you don’t make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary and ignoring three-quarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Otherwise, the arrow disappears after traveling as far as it can. On a failed save, the target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra 1d6 force damage, and you learn the target’s current location. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage, and you don’t learn its location.<br><br>The force damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.<br><br><strong><em>Shadow Arrow.</em></strong> You weave illusion magic into your arrow, causing it to occlude your foe’s vision with shadows. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away until the start of your next turn.<br><br>The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.<br><br>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconi⁠c bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can’t name the orig⁠in of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.<br><br>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55235707/lk_Cx380yudiN11O1VLDOA/med.png?1527980960\"></div><br><h3>Unexplained Powers</h3>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.<br><br>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origi⁠n. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.<br><br><h3>Creating a Sorcerer</h3>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origi⁠n of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an origi⁠n that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?<br><br>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background.

infusing you with arcane magi⁠c. This font of magic, whatever its origi⁠n, fuels your spells. See \"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and \"Sorcerer&nbsp;Spells by Level\" for the sorcerer spell list.<br><br><h4>Cantrips</h4>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantr⁠ips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantri⁠ps Known column of the Sorcerer table.<br><br><h4>Spell Slots</h4>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended sp⁠ell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>burning hands</em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>burning hands⁠</em> using either slot.<br><br><h4>Spells⁠ Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.<br><br>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spell⁠s of your choice.

For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br><br>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcastin⁠g ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when settin⁠g the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus +<br>your Charisma modifier</div><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Focus</h4>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.<br><br><h3>Sorcerous Origin⁠</h3>Choose a sorcerous origi⁠n, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.<br><br>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.<br><br><h3>Font of Magic</h3>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.<br><br><h4>Sorcery Points</h4>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.<br><br><h4>Flexible Casting</h4>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spe⁠ll slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Creating Spell S⁠lots.</em></strong> You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.

You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.<br><br>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.<br><br><h4>Careful Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.<br><br><h4>Distant Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.<br><br>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.<br><br><h4>Empowered Spell</h4>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.<br><br>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.<br><br><h4>Extended Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.<br><br><h4>Heightened Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.<br><br><h4>Quickened Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the ca⁠sting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.<br><br><h4>Subtle Spell</h4>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.<br><br><h4>Twinned Spell</h4>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).<br><br>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, <em>magic missile</em> and <em>scorching ray </em>aren’t eligible, but <em>ray of frost</em> and <em>chromatic orb</em> are.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Sorcerous Restoration</h3>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55236651/ZMnsHjCtl4vy1HzQLSfDWQ/med.png?1527981008\" alt=\"\"></div><h2>Sorcerous Origins</h2>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.

You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent.

Most live among the elementally attuned Ashari tribes of Tal’Dorei or on the Elemental Planes. However, there are no major rifts to the Elemental Planes in Wildemount, and thus no Ashari to safeguard them. The few genasi who dwell on this continent are often created as the result of a powerful elemental influence at the moment of their birth. A baby born within the eye of a hurricane might become an air genasi, while a fire genasi might be born in the midst of a raging forest fire.</p><p>Some genasi are more attuned to their native element than others. A genasi with a powerful connection to elemental fire might have their head covered by crackling flames rather than hair. A genasi with a connection to elemental water might have blue-tinged skin and appear to sweat profusely at all times.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in the Dwendalian Empire</span></h3><p>Genasi are so visually distinctive and uncommon that they are treated with equal amounts of surprise and wonder in all the nations of Wildemount. The authoritarian regime of the Dwendalian Empire reacts the most harshly to the unique power of genasi, and the Cerberus Assembly takes the greatest interest in them. Genasi are often press-ganged into joining the assembly under threat of death or exile, and most accept the offer. Those who refuse—and who survive—often take refuge in the empire’s criminal underworld, with many finding acceptance in the Myriad crime syndicate.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi on the Menagerie Coast</span></h3><p>Even the cosmopolitan people of the Clovis Concord react to the sight of a genasi with wonder. Sailors and pirates alike take special interest in genasi, for the power to harness the elements is a gift from the gods on the open sea.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi in Xhorhas</span></h3><p>Powerful storms wrack the flat plains of Xhorhas, and many who live beyond the walls of the Kryn Dynasty’s cities pray to Kord the Storm Lord to win blessings and protection from his wrath. Air, fire, and water genasi are often born under Kord’s auspices, and many become shamans serving the folk of Xhorhas. Few earth genasi roam the wastes, though some are said to dwell within the Vermaloc Wildwood.</p><p>The Kryn know little about the genasi and are eager to rectify that. Their scouts have orders to bring back any genasi they encounter to Rosohna.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Names</span></h3><p>Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.</p><hr><h3><span>Genasi Traits</span></h3><p>A genasi character has the following racial traits.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p><p><b><i>Age.</i></b> Genasi mature at about the same rate as humans and reach adulthood in their late teens. They live somewhat longer than humans do, up to 120 years.</p><p><b><i>Alignment.</i></b> Independent and self-reliant, genasi tend toward a neutral alignment.</p><p><b><i>Size.</i></b> Genasi are as varied as their mortal parents but are generally built like humans. Your size is Medium. Here’s how to determine your height and weight randomly, starting with rolling a size modifier:</p><p>Size modifier = 2d10<br><span>Height = 4 feet + 8 inches + your size modifier in inches<br></span><span>Weight in pounds = 110 + (2d4 × your size modifier)</span></p><p><b><i>Speed.</i></b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Languages. </i></b>You can speak, read, and write Common and Primordial. Primordial is a guttural language, filled with harsh syllables and hard consonants.</p><p><b><i>Subraces.</i></b> There are four major subraces of genasi: air genasi, earth genasi, fire genasi, and water genasi. Choose one of these subraces.</p><h4>Air Genasi</h4><p>As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104306932/4mk8XTHdDOHaLOb0V-gE1A/original.png?1581355028\"><br></p><p>Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Unending Breath. </i></b>You can hold your breath indefinitely while you’re not incapacitated.</p><p><b><i>Mingle with the Wind.</i></b> You can cast the levitate spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><h4>Earth Genasi</h4><p>As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you aren’t necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104306961/iP0ErPB7iz6dPC8wxS3dyw/original.png?1581355058\"><br></p><p>Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Strength score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Earth Walk.</i></b> You can move across difficult terrain made of earth and stone without expending extra movement.</p><p><b><i>Pass without Trace.</i></b> You can cast the <i>pass without trace</i> spell once with this trait, requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</p><h4>Fire Genasi</h4><p>As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104306988/LsTsz9HsuswWPU0rTQ2A5w/original.png?1581355087\"><br></p><p>Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens spot actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase.</i></b> Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Darkvision.</i></b> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Your ties to the Elemental Plane of Fire make your darkvision unusual: everything you see in darkness is a shade of red.</p><p><b><i>Fire Resistance. </i></b>You have resistance to fire damage.</p><p><b><i>Reach to the Blaze.</i></b> You know the <i>produce flame</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast <i>burning hands</i> as a 1st-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p><h4>Water Genasi</h4><p>The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths—these things call to your heart as a descendant of the turbulent marids. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.</p><p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/104306974/3SKdvbv50bTZf2f9LnPXGQ/original.png?1581355074\"><br></p><p>Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi’s hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.</p><p><b><i>Ability Score Increase. </i></b>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p><p><b><i>Acid Resistance. </i></b>You have resistance to acid damage.</p><p><b><i>Amphibious. </i></b>You can breathe air and water.</p><p><b><i>Swim. </i></b>You have a swimming speed of 30 feet.</p><p><b><i>Call to the Wave.</i></b> You know the <i>shape water</i> cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast <i>create or destroy water</i> as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to cast it this way when you finish a long rest. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

Clerics of the Cat Lord are rare and typically access the Trickery domain.</div><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Barterers of Lore</h2>\n\tTabaxi treasure knowledge rather than material things. A chest filled with gold coins might be useful to buy food or a coil of rope, but it’s not intrinsically interesting. In the tabaxi’s eyes, gathering wealth is like packing rations for a long trip. It’s important to survive in the world, but not worth fussing over.\n\t<br><br>Instead, tabaxi value knowledge and new experiences. Their ears perk up in a busy tavern, and they tease out stories with offers of food, drink, and coin. Tabaxi might walk away with empty purses, but they mull over the stories and rumors they collected like a miser counting coins.\n\t<br><br>Although material wealth holds little attraction for the tabaxi, they have an insatiable desire to find and inspect ancient relics, magical items, and other rare objects. Aside from the power such items might confer, a tabaxi takes great joy in unraveling the stories behind their creation and the history of their use.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fleeting Fancies</h2>\n\tWandering tabaxi are mercurial creatures, trading one obsession or passion for the next as the whim strikes. A tabaxi’s desire burns bright, but once met it disappears to be replaced with a new obsession. Objects remain intriguing only as long as they still hold secrets.\n\t<br><br>A tabaxi rogue could happily spend months plotting to steal a strange gem from a noble, only to trade it for passage on a ship or a week’s lodging after stealing it. The tabaxi might take extensive notes or memorize every facet of the gem before passing it on, but the gem holds no more allure once its secrets and nature have been laid bare.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tinkers and Minstrels</h2>\n\tCuriosity drives most of the tabaxi found outside their homeland, but not all of them become adventurers. Tabaxi who seek a safer path to satisfy their obsessions become wandering tinkers and minstrels.\n\t<br><br>These tabaxi work in small troupes, usually consisting of an elder, more experienced tabaxi who guides up to four young ones learning their way in the world. They travel in small, colorful wagons, moving from settlement to settlement. When they arrive, they set up a small stage in a public square where they sing, play instruments, tell stories, and offer exotic goods in trade for items that spark their interest. Tabaxi reluctantly accept gold, but they much prefer interesting objects or pieces of lore as payment.\n\t<br><br>These wanderers keep to civilized realms, preferring to bargain instead of pursuing more dangerous methods of sating their curiosity. However, they aren’t above a little discreet theft to get their claws on a particularly interesting item when an owner refuses to sell or trade it.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tabaxi Names</h2>\n\tEach tabaxi has a single name, determined by clan and based on a complex formula that involves astrology, prophecy, clan history, and other esoteric factors. Tabaxi names can apply to both males and females, and most use nicknames derived from or inspired by their full names.\n\t<br><br>Clan names are usually based on a geographical feature located in or near the clan’s territory.\n\t<br><br>The following list of sample tabaxi names includes nicknames in parenthesis.\n\t<br><br><strong>Tabaxi Names:</strong> Cloud on the Mountaintop (Cloud), Five Timber (Timber), Jade Shoe (Jade), Left-Handed Hummingbird (Bird), Seven Thundercloud (Thunder), Skirt of Snakes (Snake), Smoking Mirror (Smoke)\n\t<br><br><strong>Tabaxi Clans: </strong>Bright Cliffs, Distant Rain, Mountain Tree, Rumbling River, Snoring Mountain\n\n\n<br><br>\n<h2>Tabaxi Personality</h2>\n\tA tabaxi might have motivations and quirks much different from a dwarf or an elf with a similar background. You can use the following tables to customize your character in addition to the trait, ideal, bond, and flaw from your background.\n\t<br><br>The Tabaxi Obsession table can help hone your character’s goals. For extra fun, roll a new result every few days that pass in the campaign to reflect your ever-changing curiosity.\n\n\n<br><strong><br>\n</strong><h5>Tabaxi Obsessions</h5>\n<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d8</strong></td><td><strong>My curiosity is currently fixed on …</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A god or planar entity<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>A monster<br></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>A lost civilization<br></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A wizard’s secrets<br></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>A mundane item<br></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>A magic item<br></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>A location<br></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>A legend or tale</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<br>\n<h5>Tabaxi Quirks</h5><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>d10</strong></td><td><strong>Quirk</strong></td></tr><tr><td>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</td><td>You miss your tropical home and complain endlessly about the freezing weather, even in summer.<br></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>You never wear the same outfit twice, unless you absolutely must.<br></td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>You have a minor phobia of water and hate getting wet.<br></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Your tail always betrays your inner thoughts.<br></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>You purr loudly when you are happy.<br></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>You keep a small ball of yarn in your hand, which you constantly fidget with.<br></td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>You are always in debt, since you spend your gold on lavish parties and gifts for friends.<br></td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>When talking about something you’re obsessed with, you speak quickly and never pause and others can’t understand you.<br></td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>You are a font of random trivia from the lore and stories you have discovered.<br></td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>You can’t help but pocket interesting objects you come across.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n\n<br>\n<h2>Tabaxi Traits</h2>\n\tYour tabaxi character has the following racial traits.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Age.</em> </strong>Tabaxi have lifespans equivalent to humans.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Alignment.</em> </strong>Tabaxi tend toward chaotic alignments, as they let impulse and fancy guide their decisions. They are rarely evil, with most of them driven by curiosity rather than greed or other dark impulses.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Size.</em> </strong>Tabaxi are taller on average than humans and relatively slender. Your size is Medium.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Speed.</em> </strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You have a cat’s keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Feline Agility.</em> </strong>Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Cat’s Claws.</em> </strong>Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Cat’s Talent.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.\n\t<br><br><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.<br><br>\n\n\n\n<h3>Random Height and Weight</h3>\n\tYou may roll for your character’s height and weight. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character’s base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.\n<br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Base Height</strong></td><td><strong>Base Weight</strong></td><td><strong>Height Modifier</strong></td><td><strong>Weight Modifier</strong><br></td></tr><tr><td>4'10\"</td><td>90 lb.</td><td>+2d10</td><td>× (2d4) lb.<br></td></tr></tbody></table>\n<br>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tabaxi in the Forgotten Realms</h2>\n\tIn the Forgotten Realms, tabaxi hail from Maztica, a realm located far across the ocean west of the Sword Coast. The tabaxi of Maztica are known for their isolation, and until recently they never ventured from their homeland. The tabaxi say little of why that has changed, though rumors persist of strange happenings in that distant land.","img":""}

Whispering instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbea⁠r he’s been tracking and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.<br><br>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55900956/yK3tBE2yUdThcsYWOelzrQ/med.png?1528748175\"><br></div><br><h3>Deadly Hunters</h3>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding⁠ themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.<br><br>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their spells⁠, like their combat⁠ abilities⁠, emphasize speed, stealth⁠, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities⁠ are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.<br><br><h3>Independent Adventurers</h3>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.<br><br>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but they make up for it in other ways.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230086/z1IWiBue-85cq6evdzVfkA/med.png?1527978818\"></div><br><h3>Creating a Ranger</h3>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor slain—perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favored enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat⁠ skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the necessity of surviving in the wilds.<br><br>What’s the source of your particular hatred⁠ of a certain kind of enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they offer?<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.<br><br><strong>The Ranger</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td><br><br><br>Level</td><td><br><br>Proficiency<br>Bonus</td><td><br><br><br>Features</td><td><br><br>Spells<br>Known</td><td>Spell Lev⁠el Slots: 1st</td><td>Spell Le⁠vel Slots: 2nd</td><td>Spell L⁠evel Slots: 3rd</td><td>Spell Le⁠vel Slots: 4th</td><td>Spell L⁠evel Slots: 5th</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st</td><td>+2</td><td>Favored Enemy, Natural Explorer</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>2nd</td><td>+2</td><td>Fighting Style, Spellcasting</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>3rd</td><td>+2</td><td>Ranger Archetype, Primeval Awareness</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>4th</td><td>+2</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>+3</td><td>Extra Attack</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>6th</td><td>+3</td><td>Favored Enemy and Natural Explorer improvements</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>7th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ranger Archetype feature</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>+3</td><td>Ability Score Improvement, Land's Stride</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>+4</td><td>—</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>10th</td><td>+4</td><td>Natural Explorer improvement, Hide in Plain Sight</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ranger Archetype feature</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>12th</td><td>+4</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>7</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>+5</td><td>—</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>+5</td><td>Favored Enemy improvement, Vanish</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>15th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ranger Archetype feature</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>16th</td><td>+5</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>9</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>+6</td><td>—</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>18th</td><td>+6</td><td>Feral Senses</td><td>10</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>19th</td><td>+6</td><td>Ability Score Improvement</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>20th</td><td>+6</td><td>Foe Slayer</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55230034/IGuDEQt3Ff0DyHeivzcOoQ/med.png?1527978775\"></div><br><h2>Class Features</h2>As a ranger, you gain the following class features.<br><br><h4>Hit Points</h4><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>1d10 per ranger level<br><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level: </strong>10 + your Constitution modifier<br><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st<br><br><h4>Proficiencies</h4><strong>Armor: </strong>Light⁠ armor, medium armor, shields<br><strong>Weapons: </strong>Simple weapons, martial weapons<br><strong>Tools: </strong>None<br><br><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Strength, Dexterity<br><strong>Skills: </strong>Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth⁠, and Survival<br><br><h4>Equipment</h4>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:<br><br><ul><li>(<em>a</em>) scale mail or (<em>b</em>) leather armor</li><li>(<em>a</em>) two shortswords or (<em>b</em>) two simple melee weapons</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li><li>A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li></ul><br><h3>Favored Enemy</h3>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.<br><br>Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.<br><br>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.<br><br>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.<br><br>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.<br><br><h3>Natural Explorer</h3>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.<br><br>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:<br><br><ul><li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li><li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li><li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li><li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li><li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li><li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li></ul><br>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.<br><br><h3>Fighting Style</h3>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. <br><br>You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.<br><br><h4>Archery</h4>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.<br><br><h4>Defense</h4>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.<br><br><h4>Dueling</h4>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.<br><br><h4>Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.<br><br><h3>Spellcasting</h3>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See\"Casting a Spell\" for the general rules of spellcasting and \"Ranger Spells by Level\" for the ranger spell list.<br><br><h4>Spell Slots</h4>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>animal friendship</em> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <em>animal friendship</em>⁠ using either slot.<br><br><h4>Spells Known of 1st Level⁠ and Higher</h4>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.<br><br>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells⁠ of your choice. Each of these spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.<br><br>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement⁠ to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC </strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier </strong>= your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier</div><br><h3>Ranger Archetype</h3>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.<br><br><h3>Primeval Awareness</h3>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Extra Attack</h3>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.<br><br><h3>Land’s Stride</h3>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.<br><br>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <em>entangle</em> spell.<br><br><h3>Hide in Plain Sight</h3>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.<br><br>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.<br><br><h3>Vanish</h3>Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.<br><br><h3>Feral Senses</h3>At 18th level, you gain preternatural se⁠nses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your atta⁠ck rolls against it.<br><br>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.<br><br><h3>Foe Slayer</h3>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an atta⁠ck you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55229999/5A63ilt6k125lWtvRfixow/med.png?1527978748\"></div><h2>Subclasses<br></h2><ul><li>@Item[Hunter]</li><li>@Item[Beast Master]</li></ul><p>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</p><ul><li>@Item[Gloom Stalker]</li><li>@Item[Horizon Walker]</li><li>@Item[Monster Slayer]</li></ul>","img":""}

Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (the hawk, mastiff, and panther are examples). Add your proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in.

Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.<br><br>Harnessing divine magic⁠ doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.<br><br>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat⁠ training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55138672/PEcQrF0qhmV66RLQ6GDeDg/med.png?1527882858\"></div><br><h3>Divine Agents</h3>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and streng⁠th of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most hierarchies.<br><br>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.<br><br>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.<br><br><h3>Creating a Cleric</h3>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to embody. Appendix B includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in your campaign.<br><br>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple priests⁠ of your faith regard you: as a champion⁠ or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a special⁠ task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself worthy of a great quest?<br><br><h4>Quick Build</h4>You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or Constitution.

(if proficient)</li><li>(<em>a</em>) scale mail, (<em>b</em>) leather armor, or (<em>c</em>) chain mail (if proficient)</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (<em>b</em>) any simple weapon</li><li>(<em>a</em>) a priest’s pack or (<em>b</em>) an explorer’s pack</li><li>A shield and a holy symbol⁠</li></ul><br><h3>Spellcasting⁠</h3>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See the general rules of spellcasting and the cleric spell list.<br><br><h4>Cant⁠rips</h4>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cant⁠rips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Can⁠trips Known column of the Cleric table.<br><br><h4>Preparing and Casting Spells⁠</h4>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells⁠, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.<br><br>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells⁠ equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells⁠ must be of a level for which you have spell slots.<br><br>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells⁠ of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <em>cure wounds</em>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells⁠.<br><br>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells⁠ requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Ability</h4>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells⁠ comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting⁠ ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting⁠ the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.<br><br><div><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier<br><br><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus +<br>your Wisdom modifier</div><h4>Ritual Casting</h4>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.<br><br><h4>Spellcasting⁠ Focus</h4>You can use a holy symbol⁠ as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.<br><br><h3>Divine Domain</h3>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light⁠, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.<br><br><h4>Domain Spells⁠</h4>Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.<br><br>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.<br><br><h3>Channel Divinity</h3>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.<br><br>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.<br><br>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.<br><br>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.<br><br><h4>Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>As an action, you present your holy sym⁠bol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.<br><br>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.<br><br><h3>Ability Score Improvement</h3>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.<br><br><h3>Destroy Undead</h3>Starting at 5th level, when an undead⁠ fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.<br><br><strong>Destroy Undead</strong><br><table><thead><tr><td>Cleric Level⁠</td><td>Destroys Undead of CR...</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>5th</td><td>1/2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>8th</td><td>1 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>11th</td><td>2 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>14th</td><td>3 or lower</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>4 or lower</td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Divine Intervention</h3>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.<br><br>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.<br><br>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.<br><br>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.<br><br><h2>Divine Domains</h2>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life, and Light⁠. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.<br><br>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain⁠. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.<br><br>Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings⁠, as well as from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/55227577/8T9SDRPg0hUeE7a24cvKAg/med.png?1527977129\"></div><br><h2>Subclasses</h2><p></p><p></p><p></p><ul><li><span>@Item[Knowledge Domain]</span></li><li><span>@Item[Life Domain]<br></span></li><li><span>@Item[Light Domain]<br></span></li><li><span>@Item[Nature Domain]<br></span></li><li><span>@Item[Tempest Domain]<br></span></li><li><span>@Item[Trickery Domain]<br></span></li><li><span>@Item[War Domain]</span></li></ul><p><span>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</span></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Forge Domain#content\">Forge Domain</a></li><li><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Grave Domain#content\">Grave Domain</a></li></ul><div><span>Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica</span><br></div><div><br></div><ul><li>@Item[Order Domain]</li></ul><p>\n\t\t\t\t</p><p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}

This path also includes instruction in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits.<br><br><strong>Kensei Weapons.</strong> Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don’t already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition’s features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon—either melee or ranged—to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.<br><br><strong><em>Agile Parry. </em></strong>If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon.

When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon’s type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.<br><strong><em><br>Way of the Brush. </em></strong>You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher’s supplies or painter’s supplies.<br><br><h4>One with the Blade</h4>At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.<br><br><strong><em>Magic Kensei Weapons. </em></strong>Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.<br><br><strong><em>Deft Strike. </em></strong>When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.<br><br><h4>Sharpen the Blade</h4>At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. As a bonus action, you can expend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.<br><br><h4>Unerring Accuracy</h4>At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy.

In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian⁠ rage.<br><br>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.<br><br><h4>Spirit Seeker</h4>Yours is a path that seeks attunement⁠ with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <em>beast sense</em> and <em>speak with animals </em>spells, but only as rituals.<br><br><h4>Totem Spirit</h4>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet⁠ or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit⁠. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.<br><br>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.<br><br><strong><em>Bear. </em></strong>While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.<br><br><strong><em>Eagle. </em></strong>While you’re raging, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.<br><br><strong><em>Wolf. </em></strong>While you’re raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.<br><br><h4>Aspect of the Beast</h4>At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.<br><br><strong><em>Bear. </em></strong>You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects⁠.<br><br><strong><em>Eagle. </em></strong>You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light doesn’t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.<br><br><strong><em>Wolf. </em></strong>You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal pace.<br><br><h4>Spirit Walker</h4>At 10th level, you can cast the <em>commune with nature</em> spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the information you seek.<br><br><h4>Totemic Attunement</h4>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a different one.<br><br><strong><em>Bear. </em></strong>While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.<br><br><strong><em>Eagle. </em></strong>While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.<br><br><strong><em>Wolf. </em></strong>While you’re raging, you can use a bonus action on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with melee weapon attack.\n\t\t\t\t","img":""}
